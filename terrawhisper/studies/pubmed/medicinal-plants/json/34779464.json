They can be synthesized endogenously in the human body, but they do not fully provide all the body's requirements. Consequently, they are considered as partially essential fatty acids. MUFA represent a healthier alternative to saturated animal fats and have several health benefits, including the prevention of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its complications. This review concentrates on the major MUFA pharmacological activities in the context of MetS management, including alleviating cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dyslipidemia, central obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The beneficial effects of MUFA for CVD were found to be consistent with those of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for the alleviation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and triacylglcerol (TAG) levels, albeit MUFA had a more favorable effect on decreasing night systolic blood pressure (SBP). To reduce the obesity profile, the use of MUFA was found to induce a higher oxidation rate with a higher energy expenditure, compared with PUFA. For NAFLD, PUFA was found to be a better potential drug candidate for the improvement of liver steatosis in children than MUFA. Any advantageous outcomes from using MUFA for diabetes and insulin resistance (IR) compared to using PUFA were found to be either non-significant or resulted from a small number of meta-analyses. Such an increase in the number of studies of the mechanisms of action require more clinical and epidemiological studies to confirm the beneficial outcomes, especially over a long-term treatment period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Department, Desert Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sheashea", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition and Bromatology Group, Department of Analytical Chemistry and Food Science, Faculty of Food Science and Technology, University of Vigo - Ourense Campus, E-32004 Ourense, Spain. jianboxiao@uvigo.es."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Guangdong Ocean University, Zhanjiang 524088, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Research Center for Food Nutrition and Safety, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jianbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5139-1863"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Kasr el Aini St., P.B. 11562, Cairo, Egypt. mohamed.farag@pharma.cu.edu.eg."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, School of Sciences & Engineering, The American University in Cairo, New Cairo 11835, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34779464", "10.1039/d1fo00979f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
