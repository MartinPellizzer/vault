PHC places traditional medicine high on its list of priorities and emphasizes the availability and use of appropriate drugs. For example, countries should distribute seeds or plants to be cultivated in home or community gardens and taken as infusions. Scientists have not studied most medicinal plants which can be a rich potential resource for developing countries. Countries should apply known and effective technologies to meet health needs in a culturally acceptable manner and to promote self reliance. They must 1st strengthen data gathering and analysis capabilities needed for economic mapping of medicinal flora, then develop data centers on medicinal plants and plant derived products, such as the WHO Collaborating Center in Chicago. Clinical research should focus on the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines used by traditional health practitioners and on developing antiinfective agents. For example, 2 WHO agencies are collaborating on identifying, preparing, and testing extracts for medicinal plants for antiHIV capabilities. WHO favors developing the knowledge and skills of traditional health practitioners within the framework of PHC. Further, interregional workshops promote selection and use of traditional medicine in national PHC programs. Since there continue to be much public interest in medicinal plants, accurate information must be disseminated to the public and health professionals so they can know both the potential benefits and harmful effects of these remedies."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["068775", "00205434"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ESSENTIAL DRUGS MONITOR"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Communication", "Critique", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Economic Factors", "Education", "Health", "Health Services", "Hiv Infections", "Information Distribution", "International Agencies", "International Cooperation", "Medicine", "Organizations", "Plants, Medicinal", "Primary Health Care", "Research And Development", "Technology", "Training Activities", "Training Programs", "Un", "Viral Diseases", "Who"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12284333", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "02", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1015-0919", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "11", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991"}}, "Title": "Essential drugs monitor", "ISOAbbreviation": "Essent Drugs Monit"}, "ArticleTitle": "Medicinal plants and primary health care: part 2.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "15", "EndPage": "17", "MedlinePgn": "15-7"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Essent Drugs Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9426455", "ISSNLinking": "1015-0919"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Agencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Nations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "World Health Organization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12284333"]}}]}
