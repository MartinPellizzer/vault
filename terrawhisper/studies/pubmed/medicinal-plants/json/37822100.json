Since April 2022, leaf rot has been observed in the <i>H. plantaginea</i> plants in Wanzhou District, Chongqing City, China (31\u00ba14'58\"N, 108\u00ba53'25\"E), the initial symptom is a yellow and brown lesion on the edge of the leaf, in the late stage, brown blighted tissue caused leaves to curl and abscise. Ten typical diseased leaves were collected, the margins of infected tissues were cut into small pieces (5\u00d75 mm) and were sterilized in 75% Ethanol for 30 s, 3% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, rinsed three times with sterile water, then dried on sterile filter paper and placed to potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 25\u2103for 4 days. Thirteen isolates with morphological characteristics similar to those of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. (Nelson et al. 1983) were recovered. These isolates had white, pink and yellowish mycelia, two isolates produced irregular colonies, and remaining isolates showed round. Two of each type were selected for intensive study (yz2, yz11, yz9 and yz17). The colony of yz2 reached 62 mm in diameter on PDA medium after seven days, macroconidia were elongated sickle-shaped, 3-5 septa, and 12.92 to 21.49 \u00d7 3.42 to 5.90 \u03bcm in size, microconidia were oval and measured 5.69 to 12.95 \u00d7 3.41 to 9.80 \u03bcm in size, conidiophores were whorled and branched, yz9 attained 74 mm in diameter after nine days, macroconidia were curved sickle-shaped and apex cell acuminate, 26.9 to 57.2 \u00d7 2.4 to 7.1 \u03bcm, 3-5 septa. The microconidia were fusiform, 17.8 to 28.8 \u00d7 11.2 to 14.5 \u03bcm. Conidiophores variable in length. Genomic DNA was extracted from 7-day-old aerial mycelia of four strains (yz2, yz9, yz11 and yz17). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (White et al. 1990), translation elongation factor (<i>EF-1\u03b1</i>) (Cao et al. 2014) and partial RNA polymerase second largest subunit (<i>RPB2</i>) (Wang et al. 2019) gene regions were amplified and multilocus phylogenetic analysis was conducted, their sequences were deposited in NCBI Genbank with the following accession numbers: the strains of yz2 and yz11 with OQ829372 and OR236201 for ITS, OQ848594 and OR282462 for <i>EF-1\u03b1</i>, OR492296 and OR492297 for <i>RPB2</i>; yz9 and yz17 with OQ829383 and OR236222 for ITS, OQ848595 and OR282463 for <i>EF-1\u03b1</i>, OR492295 and OR492298 for <i>RPB2</i>. The ModelFinder was used to select the best-fit model in PhyloSuite v1.2.2, the Bayesian Inference method (BI) analysis was used to estimate the system relationship, yz9 and yz17 were identified as <i>Fusarium ipomoeae</i>, yz2 and yz11 were identified as <i>Fusarium tricinctum</i>. To verify Koch's postulates, 8 healthy plants of <i>H. plantaginea</i> (two-year-old) grown were rinsed with sterile water, after 5 leaves per plant were stabbed with a sterilized needle, 4 plants were inoculated with conidial suspension (1\u00d710<sup>6</sup> conidia mL-1), other plants injected with sterile water as control, then placed in a greenhouse maintained with 95% relative humidity at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. The symptoms on the leaves were similar to field after inoculation for 7 days, whereas all control leaves remained healthy. The same pathogen was re-isolated and re-identified based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>F. ipomoeae</i> causing leaf rot on <i>H. plantaginea</i> in China. In addition, <i>F. ipomoeae</i> was reported to cause leaf spot in Peanut (Xu et al. 2021), and <i>F. tricinctum</i> can cause fruit rot on navel orange in China (Yang et al. 2023). <i>H. plantaginea</i> as a horticultural plant is popular with some people, but it has long been threatened by <i>Fusarium.spp</i>. The finding can provide a theoretical basis for control leaf rot on <i>H. plantaginea</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, No.666 Tianxing Road, Chongqing, China, 404100; luzhou198@icloud.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 2661969571@qq.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Wenxin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 363294379@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Yuanhu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 1033570479@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yifeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, tianxing, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China, 404120; mwl313537@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Wanli", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, tianxing street, Wanzhou, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China, 404120."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 20200002@sanxiau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Fuqiang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 780906@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37822100", "10.1094/PDIS-09-23-1749-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
