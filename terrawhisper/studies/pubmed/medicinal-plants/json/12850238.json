However, recent experimental studies have not found an estrogenic action by this plant. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyse all experimental studies (in vivo and in vitro) performed on C. racemosa to elucidate its mechanism of action. Animal and in vitro experiments on C. racemosa were identified through a computerised literature searches performed on Medline (PubMed), Embase, Amed, CISCOM and Cochrane Library databases. In addition, bibliographies of the articles thus located were scanned for further relevant publications and manufactures of commercial C. racemosa preparations were asked to contribute published and unpublished material. No language restrictions were imposed. A total of 15 animal and 15 in vitro studies on C. racemosa have been found. Their results suggest that C. racemosa possesses a central activity instead of a hormonal effect. Further biological and chemical investigations are required to define its mechanism of action and to identify the compounds responsible of its actions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Pharmacology, University of Naples Federico II, Via D.
