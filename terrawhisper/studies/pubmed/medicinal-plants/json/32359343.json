The prominent role of herbal products in treating and preventing multiple diseases dates back to ancient history and most of the modern drugs today originated from their significant sources owing to their ability to control multiple targets via different signalling pathways. Among them, flavonoids consist of a large group of polyphenols, which are well known for their various therapeutic benefits. Rutin is considered one of the attractive phytochemicals and important flavonoids in the pharmaceutical industry due to its diverse pharmacological activities via various underlying molecular mechanisms. It is usually prescribed for various disease conditions such as varicosities, haemorrhoids and internal haemorrhage. In this review, we have discussed and highlighted the different molecular mechanisms attributed to the various pharmacological activities of rutin, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-allergic and antidiabetic. This review will be beneficial to herbal, biological and molecular scientists in understanding the pharmacological relevance of rutin at the molecular level."], "CopyrightInformation":
