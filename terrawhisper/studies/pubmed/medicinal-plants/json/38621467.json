Medicinal plants, such as Strychnos lucida R. Br., are empirically used to treat malaria through traditional preparation methods. However, the safety and efficacy of these plants have not yet been confirmed. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of S. lucida as an antimalarial agent.", "To quantify the concentration of brucine in the S. lucida extract, determine the acute oral toxicity of the standardized extract, and evaluate the in vivo antimalarial potency of S. lucida tablet (SLT).", "Acute oral toxicity of S.lucida extract was determined using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 420 procedure, and the analytical method for brucine quantification was validated using high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, antimalarial activity was determined using the Peter's four-day suppressive method.", "Acute toxicity analysis revealed S. lucida as a low-toxicity compound with a cut-off median lethal dose of 2000-5000\u00a0mg/kg body weight [BW], which was supported by the hematological and biochemical profiles of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Extract standardization revealed that S. lucida contained 3.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.074% w/w brucine, adhering to the limit specified in the Indonesian Herbal Pharmacopeia. Antimalarial test revealed that SLT inhibited the growth of Plasmodium berghei by 27.74-45.27%. Moreover, SLT improved the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. White blood cell and lymphocyte counts were lower in the SLT-treated group than in the K (+) group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Histopathological and biochemical evaluations revealed that S. lucida extract was safe at a dose of 2000\u00a0mg/kg BW with low toxicity. SLT inhibited Plasmodium growth and improved the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell profiles. Additionally, SLT reduced the lymphocyte and WBC counts and increased the monocyte and thrombocyte counts as part of the immune system response against Plasmodium infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
