Among various SGs, stevioside and rebaudioside A considered to be the main sweetening compounds.\u00a0 Soil salinity is one of the most essential stress in the world. Salinity affects the survival and yield of crops. In current study the effects of salinity and osmotic stress caused by different concentration of NaCl (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mM) on morphological traits, genes expressionand amount of both stevioside and rebaudioside Aunder in vitro conditions has been investigated. The morphological traits such as bud numbers, root numbers, shoot length (after 15 and 30 days) were evaluated. With increasing salinity, the values of all studied morphological traits decreased. To investigation of UGT74G1 and UGT76G1 genes expression that are involved in the synthesis of SGs, RT-PCR was done and there were significant differences between all media. The highest expression of both genes was observed in plantlets grown on MS media (with NaCl-free). Also, the lowest amounts of gene expression of the both genes were seen in MS+ 60 mM NaCl. Based on HPLC results, the highest amount of both stevioside and rebaudioside A were observed in plantlets grown in MS media (with NaCl-free). Finally, it can be concluded that stevia can survive under salt stress, but it has the best performance in the lower salinity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nokhasi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaheri", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti Ale Agha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Isfahan University of Technology, College of Agriculture, Department of Biotechnology, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansarypour", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0YON5MXJ9P", "NameOfSubstance": "stevioside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B3FUD0528F", "NameOfSubstance": "rebaudioside A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28838348", "10.14715/cmb/2017.63.7.17"]}}]}
