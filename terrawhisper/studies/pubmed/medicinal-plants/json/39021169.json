It is a complex disease caused by the imbalance between the energy intake and the energy expenditure. There are various diseases associated with obesity, i.e., diabetes, hypertension, cancer, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular problems, which produce a serious impact on the social and financial system of the population. Moreover, changing the lifestyle and other behavioral changes might help in decreasing weight loss, but it is quite challenging to achieve. Nearly 10-20% of males and 20-30% of females come under the obese condition. The most convenient therapy for treating obesity is the use of synthetic drugs available in the markets, like orlistat and sibutramine, but these drugs have serious side effects, along with this surgical procedure, and are also not safe. Various herbal medicines and bioactives are preferred as game changers. Many herbal plants and their bioactive compounds have recently demonstrated promising effects in treating obesity. They achieve this by acting on various signaling pathways, reducing the levels of hormones associated with obesity, and regulating the abundance and composition of gut microbiota. This review concludes by highlighting the potential role of various herbal plants in managing obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9948-5455"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (Pharmacy Institute), Greater Noida, U.P, 201306."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Sakshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (Pharmacy Institute), Greater Noida, U.P, 201306."}], "LastName": "Mazumder", "ForeName": "Avijit", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39021169", "10.2174/0113892010311549240627104313", "CPB-EPUB-141700"]}}]}
