Xanthones are the main bioactive compounds that exhibit diverse biological effects, such as antitumor, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, neuroprotective, antimalarial and antibacterial effects, which are consistent with its traditional uses as a folk medicine. Modern pharmacological studies show that these compounds participate in a variety of signaling pathways underlying different pathophysiologies, making them a valuable medicinal resource.", "G. oligantha is an ethnomedicine with a long history. However, due to regional and cultural constraints, the popularisation and use of ethnomedicine are still limited. Modern pharmacological and chemical research suggest that G. oligantha contains a variety of bioactive compounds and showed diverse biological functions, which is worthy of comprehensive and in-depth research. This review summarizes and discusses the recent progress in studies on G. oligantha, looking forward to promote further research and sustainable development of folk medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
