However, there has not been a comprehensive study of its flavor or the relationship between sensory and bioactive compounds. To address this issue, we examined AOF's microstructure, flavor, and metabolomic profiles during fruit maturation. The key markers used to distinguish samples included fruit expansion, testa pigmentation, aril liquefaction, oil cell expansion, peel spiciness, aril sweetness, and seed bitterness. A full-spectrum metabolomic analysis, combining a nontargeted metabolomics approach for volatile compounds and a widely targeted metabolomics approach for nonvolatile compounds, identified 1,448 metabolites, including 1,410 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Notably, 31 DAMs, including nootkatone, were associated with spicy peel, sweet aril, and bitter seeds. Correlational analysis indicated that bitterness intensity is an easy-to-use biomarker for nootkatone content in seeds. KEGG enrichment analysis linked peel spiciness to phenylpropanoid and capsaicin biosynthesis, seed bitterness to terpenoid (especially nootkatone) biosynthesis, and aril sweetness to starch and sucrose metabolism. This investigation advances the understanding of AOF's complex flavor chemistry and underlying bioactive principle, encapsulating the essence of the adage: \"no bitterness, no intelligence\" within the realm of phytochemistry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
