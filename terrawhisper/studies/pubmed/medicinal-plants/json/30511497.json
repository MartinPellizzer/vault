A. Mey and G. orientalis L.) were investigated.", "Chemical profiles were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS), as well as by their total phenolic, flavonoids, and phenolic acids contents. The antioxidant abilities of the investigated extracts were done using different assays including free radical scavenging [1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS)], reducing power (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power), phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating. Inhibitory potential against key enzymes involved in neurodegenerative diseases (cholinesterases; AChE, and BChE), diabetes (\u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase), hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase) and obesity (pancreatic lipase) were evaluated.", "Globularia trichosantha and G. orientalis extracts showed remarkable antioxidant properties, with the water extracts being a better source of antioxidant compounds. Both species showed remarkable inhibitory effects against the target enzymes. However, for both species, only the acetyl acetate and methanolic extracts were potent against cholinesterases and lipase.", "HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis revealed the presence of 107 compounds from G. trichosantha and G. orientalis, among which, 43 compounds have been preliminarily characterised for the first time from the Globulariaceae family. To date, this study can be considered as the most comprehensive research focused on the characterisation of G. trichosantha and G. orientalis. Results amassed from this study tend to show that these plants represent a rich source of biologically active compounds which can be further explored and validated for their therapeutic potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain."}], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez-P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Celia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6548-7823"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Selcuk University, Campus/Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Functional Food Centre (CIDAF), Health Science Technological Park, Granada, Spain."}], "LastName": "Segura-Carretero", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Lobine", "ForeName": "Devina", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Mohamad Fawzi", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plantaginaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30511497", "10.1002/pca.2809"]}}]}
