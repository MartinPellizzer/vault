It is a widely used herb in northwest China. However, many cases of poisoning have occurred because of TBC's intense toxicity and because its therapeutic and toxic doses are similar. Therefore, finding a safe and effective method to reduce its toxicity is an urgent task. A search through the Tibetan medicine classics shows that the processing method of TBC stir-fried with Zanba was recorded in the \"Processing specification of Tibetan medicine of Qinghai Province (2010)\". However, the specific processing parameters are not yet clear. Thus, this study aims to optimize and standardize the processing technology of Zanba-stir-fried TBC. First, a single-factor experiment was conducted on four factors: the slice thickness of TBC, amount of Zanba, processing temperature, and time. With monoester and diester alkaloid contents in Zanba-stir-fried TBC as indexes, CRITIC combined with the Box-Behnken response surface method was used to optimize the processing technology of Zanba-stir-fried TBC. The optimized processing conditions of Zanba-stir-fried TBC were a TBC slice thickness of 2 cm, three times more Zanba than TBC, a processing temperature of 125 \u00b0C, and 60 min of stir-frying. This study determined the optimized and standard processing conditions for the usage of Zanba-stir-fried TBC, thus providing an experimental basis for the safe clinical use and industrial production of Zanba-stir-fried TBC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shiling", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Liqiong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Congying", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Naiyu", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; 105114018@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Xianrong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; liuyue2@cdutcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; zhangyi@cdutcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37246864", "10.3791/65139"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
