Heating of gold nanoparticles in non-invasive radiofrequency electric field (RF-EF) is a promising and unique technique for cancer hyperthermia. However, because of differences between particles (i.e. their surface chemistry and dispersion medium) and between RF-EF sources, the research community has not reached a consensus yet. Here, we report the results of investigations on heating of gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods under RF-EF and feasibility of in-vitro cancer hyperthermia. The heating experiments were performed to investigate the role of particle shape and surface chemistry (CTAB, citrate and PEG molecules). In-vitro hyperthermia was performed on human pancreatic cancer cell (MIA Paca-2) with PEG-coated GNPs and GNRs at concentrations that were found non-toxic based on the results of cytotoxicity assay. Application of RF-EF on cells treated with PEG-GNPs and PEG-GNRs proved highly effective in killing cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine (SATiM) , Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Radiation Biology Research Center , Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine (SATiM) , Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Kharrazi", "ForeName": "Sharmin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine (SATiM) , Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy , Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAUPS) , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezayat", "ForeName": "Seyed Mahdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Pharmaceutics, Aerosol Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Medicinal Plants Research Center , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Gilani", "ForeName": "Kambiz", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cetrimonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z7FF1XKL7A", "NameOfSubstance": "Cetrimonium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cetrimonium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cetrimonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthermia, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiofrequency Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28891351", "10.1080/21691401.2017.1373656"]}}]}
