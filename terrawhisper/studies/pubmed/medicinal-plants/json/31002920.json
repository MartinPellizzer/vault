It has been used as a safety anti-hypertensive drug because of its long-acting relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle (VSM). However, whether benidipine has similar pharmacological actions in airway smooth muscle (ASM) is unknown. This research aims to reveal the relaxant property and Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonistic effect of benidipine on ASM.", "The relaxant property of mouse ASM was investigated by tissue tension tests, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonistic effect was evaluated through patch-clamp techniques.", "Benidipine caused dose-dependent relaxations on high K<sup>+</sup> (80\u202fmM) induced precontraction in mouse ASM, which relied on inhibition of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and 1\u202f\u03bcM benidipine totally blocked L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LVDCCs) currents in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Benidipine also showed dose-dependent inhibition of ACh-induced precontraction with or without the LVDCCs blocker nifedipine, and 100\u202f\u03bcM benidipine blocked ACh-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through not only LVDCCs but also non-selective cation channels (NSCCs).", "Benidipine blocked LVDCCs and NSCCs to abolish these channels-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which relaxed precontracted ASM.
