Herein, ten predictive models derived from 1330 unique molecules against CDK9 were constructed based on molecular fingerprints and graphs using two conventional machine learning and four deep learning methods. The evaluation results showed that FP-GNN deep learning architecture performed best for CDK9 inhibitors prediction with the highest BA and F1 values of 0.681 and 0.912 for testing set. We then performed virtual screening to identify new CDK9 inhibitors by incorporating the optimal established predictive model and molecular docking. Five compounds were identified to show broad anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines through bioassays. For example, C9 exhibited antiproliferative activities against HeLa, MOLM-13 and MDA-MB-231 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.53, 3.92 and 11.65\u00a0\u03bcM. Kinase inhibition assay results demonstrated that these compounds displayed submicromolar (214\u00a0\u223c\u00a0504\u00a0nM) inhibitory activities against CDK9. Further cellular mechanism evaluation revealed that C9 suppressed the activity of CDK9 and interfered with the expression of Mcl-1 and cleaved PARP in MOLM-13 cells, resulting in the induction of cellular apoptosis. In addition, C9 displayed a good stability in rat liver microsomes, artificial gastrointestinal fluid and plasm. An online platform (called DEEPCDK9Pred) was developed based on the FP-GNN models to predict or design new CDK9 inhibitors. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that FP-GNN algorithm can achieve accurate prediction of CDK9 inhibitors and the subsequent discovery of C9 as a new potential CDK9 inhibitor deserves further structural modification for the treatment of leukemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
