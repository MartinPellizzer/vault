In situ intestinal circulation perfusion model was employed to investigate the differences in intestinal absorption characteristics of C. auriculatum extract under the influence of different intestinal segments, different drug concentrations, and bile in the normal and functional dyspepsia(FD) states. The results showed that the absorption of baishouwu benzophenone decreased with the increase in the concentration of C. auriculatum extract(P&lt;0.01), while the absorption of syringic acid and other components increased in a dose-independent manner, suggesting that baishouwu benzophenone might follow active absorption, while other components might not be on a single absorption pattern. The main absorption sites of each component in the normal state were different from those in the FD state. The cumulative absorption conversion rates in the FD state were generally lower than those in the normal state, and bile inhibited the absorption of other components except for scopoletin in both states(P&lt;0.05). As revealed, the small intestine showed selectivity to the absorption of drugs, and the pathological state(such as FD) and bile both affected the absorption of the main components, which provides a theoretical basis for the development of new drugs and further development of C. auriculatum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li-Qin", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gou", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Si-Ying", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "E390O181H5", "NameOfSubstance": "syringic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KLF1HS0SXJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopoletin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cynanchum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scopoletin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604878", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220621.203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
