This study aims to explore the influence of light intensity on growth and quality of Panax quinquefolius. To be specific, sand culture experiment was carried out in a greenhouse under the light intensity of 40, 80, 120, and 160 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1), respectively. The growth indexes, photosynthetic characteristics, content of 6 ginsenosides of the 3-year-old P. quinquefolius were determined, and the expression of ginsenoside synthesis-related enzyme genes in leaves, main roots, and fibrous roots was determined. The results showed that the P. quinquefolius growing at 80 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1) light intensity had the most biomass and the highest net photosynthetic rate. The total biomass of P. quinquefolius treated with 120 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1) light intensity was slightly lower than that with 80 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1). The root-to-shoot ratio in the treatment with 120 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1) light intensity was up to 6.86, higher than those in other treatments(P&lt;0.05),and the ginsenoside content in both aboveground and underground parts of P. quinquefolius in this treatment was the highest, which was possibly associated with the high expression of farnesylpyrophosphate synthase(FPS), squalene synthase(SQS), squalene epoxidase(SQE), oxidosqualene cyclase(OSC), dammarenediol-\u2161 synthase(DS), and P450 genes in leaves and SQE and DS genes in main roots. In addition, light intensities of 120 and 160 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1) could promote PPD-type ginsenoside synthesis in leaves by triggering up-regulation of the expression of upstream ginsenoside synthesis genes. The decrease in underground biomass accumulation of the P. quinquefolius grown under weak light(40 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1)) and strong light(160 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1)) was possibly attributed to the low net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate in leaves. In the meantime, the low expression of SQS, SQE, OSC, and DS genes in the main roots might led to the decrease in ginsenoside content. However, there was no significant correlation between the ginsenoside content and the expression of synthesis-related genes in the fibrous roots of P. quinquefolius. Therefore, the light intensity of 80 and 120 \u03bcmol\u00b7m~(-2)\u00b7s~(-1) is beneficial to improving yield and quality of P. quinquefolius. The above findings contributed to a theoretical basis for reasonable shading in P. quinquefolius cultivation, which is of great significance for improving the yield and quality of P. quinquefolius through light regulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zi-Qi", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Hui-Hui", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sand"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Squalene Monooxygenase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36164897", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220602.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
