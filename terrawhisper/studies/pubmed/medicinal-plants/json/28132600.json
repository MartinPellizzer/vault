The TH activity in the adrenal medulla, heart, and hypothalamus of the rats was significantly increased in the L-NAME group vs. control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Treatment with L-NAME led to a significant increase in blood pressure (BP) in the L-NAME group compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These data suggest that propolis, pollen, and CAPE may mediate diminished TH activity in the heart, adrenal medulla, and hypothalamus in hypertensive rats. The decreased TH activity may be due to the modulation and synthesis of catecholamines and BP effects. In addition, the binding mechanism of CAPE within the catalytic domain of TH was investigated by means of molecular modeling approaches. These data suggest that the amino acid residues, Glu429 and Ser354 of TH may play a pivotal role in the stabilization of CAPE within the active site as evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Gibbs binding free energy (\u0394G<sub>binding</sub>) of CAPE in complex with TH was also determined by post-processing MD analysis approaches (i.e. Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Computational Biology and Molecular Simulations Laboratory, Department of Biophysics , School of Medicine, Bahcesehir University , Istanbul , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ekhteiari Salmas", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Computational Biology and Molecular Simulations Laboratory, Department of Biophysics , School of Medicine, Bahcesehir University , Istanbul , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Durdagi", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Vocational School of Technical Sciences , Aksaray , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gulhan", "ForeName": "Mehmet Fuat", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Faculty of Arts and Science, Department of Biotechnology , Omer Halisdemir University , Nigde 51240 , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Duruyurek", "ForeName": "Merve", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacology , New York Medical College , Valhalla 10595 , NY , USA."}], "LastName": "Abdullah", "ForeName": "Huda I", "Initials": "HI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Faculty of Arts and Science, Department of Biotechnology , Omer Halisdemir University , Nigde 51240 , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Selamoglu", "ForeName": "Zeliha", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catecholamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-62-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Propolis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.16.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G960R9S5SK", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid phenethyl ester"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ML9LGA7468", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V55S2QJN2X", "NameOfSubstance": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Medulla"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Catecholamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothalamus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Propolis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28132600", "10.1080/07391102.2017.1288660"]}}]}
