The antimicrobial activity of the oil was evaluated against eight bacterial and three fungal pathogenic strains. The results revealed that the essential oil exhibited a moderate-to-potent anti-microbial activity against all the microorganisms tested. Gram-positive bacteria were noted to be more sensitive to the oil than gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation against HeLa cell lines showed that the essential oil exhibited moderate cytotoxicity on human tumor cells, with a high IC<sub>50</sub> value of 175\u03bcg/mL. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of Thymelaea hirsuta essential oil. Overall, the results indicate that the T. hirsuta essential oil has a number of attractive properties that might open new promising opportunities for the control or prevention of a wide range of microbial infections and cancers and can facilitate the use of essential oils as natural preservatives against spoilage microorganisms in food systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Felhi", "ForeName": "Samir", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Chaaibia", "ForeName": "Mouna", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Bakari", "ForeName": "Sana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit of Biotechnology and pathologies, Higher Institute of Biotechnology, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Riadh Ben", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, ISET, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "B\u00e9kir", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Gharsallah", "ForeName": "N\u00e9ji", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Sfax, Tunisia / College of Science and Arts in Baljurashi, Al Baha University, P.
