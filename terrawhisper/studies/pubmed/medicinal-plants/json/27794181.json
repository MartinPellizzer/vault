For further development and better pharmacological elucidation, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to characterize its preclinical pharmacokinetics. The study samples were analyzed using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography-ultra violet (HPLC-UV) methods. CRD is partially soluble (<10\u2009\u03bcM) and possess high permeability (>0.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4\u2009cm/sec). It is moderately bound to plasma proteins (<50%). It shows partitioning in red blood cell (RBC) compartment with the partition coefficient between RBCs and plasma (K<sub>RBC/P</sub> ) of 0.95 at 0\u2009min to 1.39 at 60\u2009min, indicating significant but slow RBC uptake. In mice, CRD is poorly absorbed after oral administration with 18% oral bioavailability. It possesses high clearance, short mean residence time, and high volume of distribution in mice. It exhibited multiple peak phenomena both after oral and intravenous administration and is excreted both as conjugated and unchanged CRD in bile. It is majorly excreted in faeces and negligibly in urine. The preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion data are expected to succour the future clinical investigations of CRD as a promising anticancer agent.
