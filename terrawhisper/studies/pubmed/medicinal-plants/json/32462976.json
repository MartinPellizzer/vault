The biological activity of the extract, fractions and pure compounds was evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was investigated against 3 fungi species, 3 gram\u2009+\u2009ve and 3 gram -ve bacteria. The crude extract and fractions showed moderate inhibition against some of the tested microorganisms, especially the butanol fraction exhibited the maximum inhibition zone against <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> (16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.60\u2009mm). Cytotoxicity was evaluated against HepG-2 and MCF-7 cell lines. Hexane fraction exhibited the highest cytotoxic effect against HepG-2 and MCF-7 cell lines with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 and 19.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009\u00b5g/ml, respectively with compared to other fractions. The isolates were identified as octacosanoic acid (<b>1</b>), glyceryl trilinoleate (<b>2</b>), oleic acid (<b>3</b>), and the epimeric mixture of saringosterols (<b>4, 5</b>), \u03b2-sitosterol (<b>6</b>), glycoglycerolipid (<b>7</b>) and a mixture of kjellmanianone and loliolide (<b>8, 9</b>) by spectroscopic analysis. Among the all tested compounds kjellmanianone and loliolide mixture exhibited significant cytotoxic activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 7.27\u2009\u00b5g/ml against HepG-2 cells. The major and minor constituents of the extract and fractions were identified using GC-MS analysis. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that most of the studied compounds especially compounds 8 and 9 strongly interact with TPK and VEGFR-2 with highest binding energies supported that the high cytotoxicity of these compounds against human hepatocellular cancer in the experimental part. The energetic, geometric and topological properties of compounds 8 and 9 binding with cytosine base were computed by DFT methods. Molecular properties descriptors, bioactivity score and ADMET analysis confirmed that most of the studied compounds especially compounds 8 and 9 exhibit significant biological activities and have a better chance to be developed as drug leads.
