Skeels is an evergreen small tree or shrub with great economic value, which belongs to the genus Clausena of the Rutaceae family. C. lansium is indigenous to Southern China, while currently widely cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions not only for the nutritional value and pharmacological uses of its fruits but also as a medicinal and ornamental plant. In this study, a systematic phytochemical study on the stems and leaves of C. lansium caused the separation and identification of two new geranylated carbazole alkaloids, clauselansiumines A (1) and B (2), as well as 10 known geranylated carbazole alkaloids (3-12). The chemical structures of these isolated geranylated carbazole alkaloids (1-12) were unambiguously determined based on comprehensive spectral data analyses. All these isolated geranylated carbazole alkaloids were tested for their neuroprotective effects against 6-hydroxydopamine induced cell death in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. Compounds 1-12 displayed remarkable neuroprotective effects holding the EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.48\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04 to 12.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16\u202f\u03bcM. These research results disclosed that the separation and purification of these geranylated carbazole alkaloids possessing remarkable neuroprotective effects separated from C. lansium could be extremely important to the discovery of new agents for the treatment and prevention for Parkinson's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
