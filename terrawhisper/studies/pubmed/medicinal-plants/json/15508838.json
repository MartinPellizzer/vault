However, a number of ginkgolic acids with different side chains may be present and this makes their analysis by conventional chromatographic methods more complex. In this study, 1H-NMR spectrometry was applied to the analysis of the total content of ginkgolic acids in leaves of Ginkgo biloba and in six types of commercial Ginkgo products in the absence of chromatographic purification. For this analysis, protons H-3, H-4, and H-5, which are well separated in the range 8 (ppm) 6.5-7.5 in the 1H-NMR spectrum, were utilised. For further confirmation, the correlations of H-3, H-4 and H-5 were examined by 1H-1H COSY spectra in all extracts. The quantity of the compounds was calculated from the relative ratio of the integral of each peak to the integral of the peaks of a known amount (100 microg) of anthracene used as an internal standard. The quantitative results obtained by 1H-NMR analysis were compared with those obtained by GC, which showed that the 1H-NMR method allows a simple quantification of total ginkgolic acids in Ginkgo extracts without any pre-purification steps."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section Metabolomics Institute of Biology, Leiden University, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Young Hae", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyung-Kyoon", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peltenburg-Looman", "ForeName": "A M G", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lefeber", "ForeName": "Alfons W M", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verpoorte", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22910-60-7", "NameOfSubstance": "ginkgolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15508838", "10.1002/pca.786"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
