Sixty-six mice were randomly assigned into 6 groups (n=11 in ench): na\u00efve, control, LD 4HF (low dose 4HF), HD 4HF (high dose 4HF), LD 4HF + D (low dose and doxorubicin), and D (doxorubicin). Apart from the na\u00efve group, each mouse received subcutaneous inoculation with 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> 4T1 cells resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of normal saline in the mammary fat pads. Starting from the day of tumor cell inoculation, tumors were grown for 6 days. The LD and HD groups received daily oral gavage of 658 and 2,630 mg/kg 4HF, respectively. The LD 4HF+D group received daily oral gavage of 658 mg/kg 4HF and weekly intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg). The D group received weekly intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg). The treatment na\u00efve mice received daily oral gavage of 0.2 mL double distilled water and 0.1 mL normal saline via intraperitoneal injection once a week. The control group received daily oral gavage of 0.2 mL double-distilled water. The treatment period was 30 days. At the end of treatment, mice organs were harvested to analyze immunological activities via immunophenotyping, gene and multiplex analysis, histological staining, and gut microbiota analysis.", "Mice treated with the combination of 4HF and doxorubicin resulted in significantly reduced tumor and spleen burdens (P<0.05), altered the hypoxia and overall immune lymphocyte landscape, and manipulated gut microbiota to favor the anti-tumor immunological activities. Moreover, immunosuppressive genes, cytokines, and chemokines such as C-C motif chemokine 2 and interleukin-10 of tumors were significantly downregulated (P<0.05). 4HF-doxorubicin combination treatment demonstrated synergetic activities and was most effective in activating the anti-tumor immune response (P<0.05).", "The above results provide evidence for evaluating the immune regulating mechanisms of 4HF in breast cancer and support its clinical significance in its potential as an adjunctive therapeutic agent or immune supplement."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
