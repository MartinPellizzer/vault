The rams were maintained in individual pens (3 x 9 m) with free access to feed, water, salt and shade. On Day 7 after initiating locoweed, serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) increased (P < 0.01), and serum thyroxine (T4) decreased (P < 0.01) in locoweed-fed rams. Effects on serum AP and T4 remained constant in rams during the 21 d of locoweed feeding. Treatment with MUSE did not influence (P > 0.10) AP or T4. Locoweed-fed rams had reduced (P < 0.05) intake and body weight for the 2-wk period after locoweed feeding ended. The MUSE regimen or diet had no effect on intake or body weight (P > 0.50). Neither locoweed nor MUSE affected serum LH before or after GnRH administration on Day 22 (P > 0.10). On Day 50, however, area under the LH curve (AUC) was 966 units in locoweed-fed rams and 1,373 units (+/- 154) in controls (P = 0.09). Serum testosterone (T) was reduced in locoweed-fed rams before and after (P < 0.05) GnRH on Day 22. On Day 50, the T AUC was numerically lower (P = 0.14) in locoweed-fed rams (1,252 units) than in controls (1,539 +/- 130 units). Conversely, MUSE treatment resulted in increased (P = 0.02) T AUC on Day 50 (1,148 and 1,643 +/- 130 units in control and MUSE-treated ram lambs, respectively). During the 6-wk period after locoweed feeding, serum immunoglobulin G averaged 14.0 and 18.6 (+/- 1.1) mg/mL in control and locoweed-fed rams (P < 0.01), respectively. Twenty percent dietary locoweed for 21 d exerts adverse effects on feed intake, growth, and reproduction in young ram lambs and MUSE was not effective in reversing these effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Range Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces 88003, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hallford", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duff", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Theriogenology", "NlmUniqueID": "0421510", "ISSNLinking": "0093-691X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Foodborne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10735112", "10.1016/s0093-691x(99)00194-6", "S0093691X99001946"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
