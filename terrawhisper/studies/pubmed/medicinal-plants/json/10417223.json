Measurements were performed at dissolved oxygen tensions of 31-450% air saturation. Critical oxygen concentrations for Atropa belladonna hairy roots were above air saturation, viz. 100-125% air saturation for oxygen uptake and 150% air saturation for growth, demonstrating that these roots cultivated in reactors with air sparging are oxygen-limited. The critical oxygen tension for oxygen uptake by Solanum aviculare hairy roots was 75% air saturation. Both the specific oxygen uptake rate and specific growth rate of A. belladonna hairy roots were dependent on the mass (g dry weight) of roots present; even in the absence of boundary layers, growth did not remain exponential over the entire culture period. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy showed that hairy roots grown submerged in liquid medium were covered with thick layers of hydrated mucilage and root hairs, representing a significant additional barrier to oxygen transfer. Roots protruding out of the liquid medium showed no evidence of mucilage accumulation. The specific oxygen demand of A. belladonna root tips was 3.3-11.5 times higher than for the remainder of the roots, the ratio increasing as the dissolved oxygen tension was reduced. Specific growth rates, biomass yields from sugar, and atropine levels were maximum at around 150% air saturation, but decreased significantly with oxygen concentrations above ca. 200%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of New South Wales, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Doran", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Bioeng", "NlmUniqueID": "7502021", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Atropa belladonna"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Solanaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10417223", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19990920)64:6<729::aid-bit13>3.0.co;2-y", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19990920)64:6<729::AID-BIT13>3.0.CO;2-Y"]}}]}
