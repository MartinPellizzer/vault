GR-2IIc-1-2A showed the most potent anti-complementary activity. GR-2IIa-1-5 and GR-2IIb-1-5 contained 40-85% and 50-90% of GalA, respectively, in addition to Rha, Ara, and Gal. GR-2IIc-1-2A and -2IIc-2 mainly comprised Glc, Gal, GalA, and GlcA in addition to Rha, Fuc, Xyl, Ara, and Man. Methylation analysis and digestion with endo-alpha-(1----4)-polygalacturonase indicated that all of the polysaccharides contained polygalacturonan regions which were frequently methyl-esterified. GR-2II-a, -2IIb, and -2IIc gave enzyme-resistant fractions of large and intermediate sizes, in addition to oligogalacturonides. Each large fraction from GR-2IIa and -2IIb consisted mainly of Ara, Gal, and GalA, whereas the intermediate fractions were composed of small proportions of 2-Me-Fuc, 2-Me-Xyl, and apiose (Api), in addition to Rha, Ara, Gal, and GalA. The large fraction from GR-2IIc mainly contained Rha, Man, Gal, and GalA in addition to Fuc, Ara, Xyl, and Glc, whereas the intermediate fraction consisted of 2-Me-Fuc, 2-Me-Xyl, and Api, in addition to Rha, Ara, GalA, Fuc, Xyl, Man, Gal, and Glc. Base-catalysed beta-elimination followed by ethylation indicated that all the polysaccharides except GR-2IIc-2 contained a 4-linked uronic acid attached to position 2 of 2,4-linked Rha. Single radial gel diffusion, using the beta-D-glucosyl-Yariv antigen, indicated that GR-2IIa-1 and GR-2IIc-2 contained relatively large proportions of (1----3,6)-beta-D-galactan moieties. The anti-complementary activities of GR-2IIa-3, GR-2IIa-4, and GR-2IIb-4 decreased after de-esterification followed by digestion with endo-alpha-(1----4)-polygalacturonase. The large fractions from GR-2IIa-2IIc showed more potent anti-complementary activities than the original polysaccharide fractions, whereas the intermediate fractions and oligogalacturonides were inactive. The large fraction from GR-2IIc had more potent mitogenic activity than GR-2IIc, whereas the intermediate fraction and oligogalacturonides from GR-2IIc were inactive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center of the Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawamura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "89NA02M4RX", "NameOfSubstance": "Pectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Polygalacturonase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polygalacturonase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1804531", "10.1016/0008-6215(91)89049-l", "0008-6215(91)89049-L"]}}]}
