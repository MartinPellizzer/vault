In Morocco, a wide range of medicinal plants has taken great importance in the treatment of diabetes, among these plants; we find Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels.", "The objective of our work is based on the evaluation of the effect of roasted (Roil) and unroasted (UnRoil) Argan seed oil on diabetic nephropathy.", "Roasted and unroasted oils from Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels seeds were examined for their effects on diabetic nephropathy using an experimental streptozotocin-induced model. Biochemical and histopathological analyses were conducted on blood and kidney samples to assess renal function and tissue damage.", "Both oils ameliorated significantly diabetic nephropathy symptoms. They limited the renal damage caused by streptozotocin and improved diabetes symptoms, including blood glucose levels, body weight, water intake, urinary volume, and kidney parameters. This activity could be elucidated by the antioxidant effect of Argan oil, enabling to neutralize free radicals and undertake a fundamental role in preventing the onset of these complications.", "Based on our findings, Argan oil could be used as dietary supplement for people with diabetes as a preventive measure against the emergence of diabetic complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
