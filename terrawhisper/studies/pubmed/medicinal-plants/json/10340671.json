Broccoli florets, shredded carrots, and green beans inoculated with approximately 10(2) C. botulinum spores per g were placed in bags (1.4 kg per bag) composed of four films with different oxygen transmission rates (OTRs). Broccoli was packaged in bags with OTRs of 3 (7,000 cm3/m2/24 h) and 4 (16,000 cm3/m2/24 h), and green beans were packaged in bags with OTRs of 2 (6,000 cm3/m2/24 h) and 4. Broccoli and green beans in bags were compressed and heat-sealed. Shredded carrots were packaged in bags with OTRs of 1 (3,000 cm3/m2/24 h) and 3 and vacuum-sealed. Produce was stored at 4, 13, and 21 degrees C for up to 27 (broccoli) or 28 (carrots and green bean) days and analyzed periodically. At each sampling time, gas composition within the bags, pH of the produce microbial population (total aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, psychrotrophic bacteria, yeasts, and molds), and the presence or absence of botulinal toxin were determined. Packaging material affected the quality of vegetables, especially broccoli stored at 4 and 13 degrees C. For example, broccoli was scored as \"good\" after 22 days at 4 degrees C when it was packaged in film with higher gas permeability (OTR of 4), whereas broccoli appeared to be in \"poor\" condition when packaged in film with lower gas permeability (OTR of 3). With the exception of lactic acid bacteria, packaging material did not noticeably influence the growth of microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria grew better in broccoli packaged in bags with an OTR of 3 than in those with an OTR of 4 at all temperatures. Botulinal toxin was detected in broccoli packaged in bags with an OTR of 3 and stored at 13 degrees C for 21 days and in those with an OTR of 4 and 3 and stored at 21 degrees C for 10 days. All toxic samples were visibly spoiled. Toxin was not detected in produce packaged under any other test conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Food Safety and Quality Enhancement and Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Georgia, Griffin 30223-1797, USA."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Y Y", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brackett", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beuchat", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Doyle", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.69", "NameOfSubstance": "Botulinum Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Botulinum Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium botulinum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10340671", "10.4315/0362-028x-62.5.499", "S0362-028X(22)03880-7"]}}]}
