Despite the availability of several treatment options, the five-year survival rate of NSCLC is extremely low (<20%). This underlines the necessity of more effective therapeutic alternatives. In this context, plant-derived extracts and bioactive molecules extracted from plants, known collectively as phytoceuticals, represent an extremely variegated source of bioactive compounds with potent anticancer potential. In the present study, we tested the in vitro anticancer activity of a polyherbal preparation, VEDICINALS\u00ae9, containing nine different bioactive principles extracted by medicinal plants.", "The anticancer activity of VEDICINALS\u00ae9 was investigated by measuring its impact on A549 human NSCLC cell proliferation (MTT assay and trypan blue staining), migration (wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay) and by measuring the impact on the expression of cancer-related proteins (Human XL Oncology Protein Array).", "We show that VEDICINALS\u00ae9 at a concentration of 0.2% v/v has potent anticancer effect, significantly inhibiting A549 cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, this was achieved by downregulating the expression of proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation (Axl, FGF basic, enolase 2, progranulin, survivin) and migration (Dkk-1, cathepsins B and D, BCL-x, amphiregulin, CapG, u-plasminogen activator). Furthermore, treatment with VEDICINALS\u00ae9 resulted in increased expression of the oncosuppressor protein p53 and of the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin.", "Taken together, our results provide proof of principle of the potent anticancer activity of the polyherbal preparation VEDICINALS\u00ae9, highlighting its enormous potential as an alternative or adjuvant therapy for lung cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
