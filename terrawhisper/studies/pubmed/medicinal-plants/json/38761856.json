In this study, liposomes composed of neutral saturated/unsaturated phospholipids, anionic and cationic phospholipids were constructed to investigate how surface potential and the degree of saturation of fatty acid chains determined their mucus and epithelium permeability both in vitro and in vivo. Our results clearly indicated that liposomes composed of saturated neutral and anionic phospholipids possessed high stability and permeability, compared to that of liposomes composed of unsaturated phospholipids and cationic phospholipids. Furthermore, both in vivo imaging of fluorescence-labeled liposomes and biodistribution of salvianolic acid B (SAB) that encapsulated in liposomes were performed to estimate the effect of phospholipids on the lung exposure and retention of inhaled liposomes. Finally, inhaled SAB-loaded liposomes exhibited enhanced therapeutic effects in a bleomycin-induced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis mice model via inhibition of inflammation and regulation on coagulation-fibrinolytic system. Such findings will be beneficial to the development of inhalable lipid-based nanodrug delivery systems for the treatment of respiratory diseases where inhalation is the preferred route of administration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
