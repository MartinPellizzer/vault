Chemotherapy is an important anti-breast tumor therapy, which can be used in almost every stage of breast tumor therapy alone or in the combination with surgery and radiation therapy. Alkaloids are a kind of ubiquitous natural products, and important active components of various medicinal plants. A large number of studies have shown that alkaloids could exert an anti-breast tumor effect by inhibiting proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, resisting mitosis, promoting apoptosis and autophagy, and triggering cell cycle arrest. The extensive anti-breast tumor effect makes alkaloids an important candidate drug source. This paper reviews the anti-breast tumor mechanism of natural products of alkaloids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Shanghai 201318, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Shanghai 201318, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qun-Li", "Initials": "QL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Shanghai 201318, China."}], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Wang-Chun", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Shanghai 201318, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Shanghai 201318, China Graduate School, Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autophagy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645117", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20201015.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
