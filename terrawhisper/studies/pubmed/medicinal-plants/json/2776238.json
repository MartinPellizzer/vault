Two known flavonoid glycosides, hyperin and quercitrin, were isolated from Taxillus yadoriki Danser, together with fatty acids, phytosterol, and phytosterol-glucoside. There was remarkable variation of contents of quercitrin among the plants on different host trees. From Taxillus kaempferi Danser, fatty acids, phytosterol, phytosterol-glucoside, quercetin, avicularin, and taxillusin were isolated, and quercitrin and hyperin were also identified. There was no remarkable variation of compositions of flavonoid glycosides among the plants on different host trees. A known flavone glycoside, chrysoeriol-4'-O-glucoside, was isolated from Korthalsella japonica Engler, together with fatty acids, phytosterol, oleanolic acid, and phytosterol-glucoside. Chrysoeriol-4'-O-glucoside is contained in this plant irrespective of the host trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukunaga", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishiya", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kajikawa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takeya", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Itokawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2776238", "10.1248/cpb.37.1543"]}}]}
