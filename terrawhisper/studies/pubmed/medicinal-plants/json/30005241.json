Considering quality and safety of these herbal beverages, widely practiced in herbalism for medicinal and supplementing purposes, element analysis is important, and quality of its results should not raise any doubts about reliability. Hence, original researches devoted to element analysis of decoctions and infusions of medicinal plants and herbs, published after 2000, have been surveyed in details, particularly focusing on sources of elements in medicinal plants, their availability for the intake during preparation of infusions and decoctions as well as different methodological aspects related to element analysis by atomic spectrometry, including sample pretreatment and preparation before measurements, calibration methods used, and verification of reliability of results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
