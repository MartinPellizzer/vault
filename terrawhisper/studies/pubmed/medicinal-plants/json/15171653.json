The crude extract of pine needles was fractionated into four fractions by Et2O, EtOAc and n-BuOH. Various column chromatography with D-101 macroreticular resin, Toyopearl HW-40 and silica gel were employed for the isolation and purification of compounds from the n-BuOH fraction of pine needles. The structures of the compounds were identified by physiochemical properties and spectral analysis (UV, IR, MS, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, DEPT, HMQC, HMBC, etc.).", "Four compounds were isolated from the n-BuOH fraction of water-extracts, and their structures were identified as 3-methoxyl-9'-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-4':7,5':8-diepoxyneoligan-4,9-diol (massonianoside E, I), 4,4',8,8',9-pentahydroxyl-3,3'-dimethoxyl-7,9'-monoepoxylignan (II), umbelliferon (III), 4-(4'-hydroxyl-3'-methoxylbenzyl)-2-butanone (IV).", "Compound I is a new compound, and compounds II, III and IV were isolated from this plant for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450008, China. fwsh@371.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Wei-sheng", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-zhi", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xiao-ke", "Initials": "XK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Yue-feng", "Initials": "YF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-methoxyl-9'-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-4',7-diepoxyneoligan-4,9-diol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Umbelliferones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Umbelliferones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15171653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
