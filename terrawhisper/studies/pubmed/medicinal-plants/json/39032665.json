However, no scientific investigation has been made for its folkloric use by the \"Baka\" Pygmies of Cameroon as an aphrodisiac.", "To investigate the aphrodisiac and androgenic activities of the aqueous extract of the roots of Schumanniophyton magnificum in male rats and analyze the phytoconstituents by UHPLC/MS.", "Twenty-five male rats of 16-weeks old were divided into 5 groups and orally treated for 30 days with distilled water (10\u00a0ml/kg), or sildenafil citrate (5\u00a0mg/kg), or the aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum (43\u00a0mg/kg, 86\u00a0mg/kg and 172\u00a0mg/kg). The sexual behaviour parameters were monitored on day 1 and 30 by pairing male rats to receptive females. At the end of the experiment, rats were killed and the blood and reproductive organs were collected for histological sectioning, sperm analysis and biochemical analysis. The presence of phytoconstituents and their structures were revealed by UHPLC/MS.", "The plant extract significantly increased the mount, ejaculation and intromission frequencies in comparison to those in the normal control group; and significantly doubled the serum testosterone levels (2.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.70\u00a0ng/ml) compared to the normal control group. UHPLC/MS of the aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum identified 7 major compounds such as Schumanniofioside A, Noreugenin and Rohitukine, with antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The plant extracts significantly increased the penile nitric oxide levels (P <0.05). These results were similar to those obtained after administration of sildenafil citrate.", "The aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum could be an alternative for erectile dysfunction management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
