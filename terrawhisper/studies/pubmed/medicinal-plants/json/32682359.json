The induction of apoptosis by LE and FE was also consistent with increased expression of caspase mRNAs and DNA fragmentation. In terms of the proteomic approach, 27 differentially expressed proteins were detected and identified through MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. These altered proteins were involved in cytoskeleton organization and movement, protein folding, proteolysis and translation, cell cycle and proliferation, signal transduction, cell redox homeostasis, and metabolism.", "Up-regulation of protein disulfide isomerases and down-regulation of Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and heat shock proteins may contribute to the induction of apoptosis and arresting of the cell cycle in HeLa cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6819-9891"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Literature, Afyon Kocatepe University, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4817-1100"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Literature, Afyon Kocatepe University, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Terzi", "ForeName": "Hakan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3727-3662"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "ForeName": "Saliha Handan", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5002-943X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Varol", "ForeName": "Nuray", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3434-8545"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "\u00d6zdem\u0130r Erdo\u011fan", "ForeName": "M\u00fcjgan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8527-2096"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Kasap", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6816-9687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Ak\u00e7al\u0131", "ForeName": "Nermin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5348-9645"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"}], "LastName": "Solak", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turk J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9441758", "ISSNLinking": "1300-0144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"}], "CoiStatement": "none declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ferlay J Soerjomataram I Dikshit R Eser S Mathers C Cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012.
