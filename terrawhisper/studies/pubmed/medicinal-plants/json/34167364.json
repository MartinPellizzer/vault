In this study, we elucidated the impact of the <i>AT</i> on anxiety-related behaviors, reproductive parameters, antioxidant capacity in male rats subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS).", "35 Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, CRS-control (received normal saline) and three CRS-treated groups received <i>AT</i> extract (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 21 consequences days. To induce CRS rats, the rats were immobilized for 21 days and received the extract orally. On the last day of treatment, anxiety-related behaviors were assessed through the sucrose preference test (SPT) as well as elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. Corticosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone levels were evaluated to determine reproductive capacity. Sperm parameters including the total count, motility, and viability were also analyzed. Weight of body, testis and seminal vesicles was measured as well.", "The findings revealed that 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg of <i>AT</i> extract had anxiolytic effects in CRS rats, as confirmed by the EPM test and SPT. In addition, <i>AT</i> extract could improve fertile capacity and sperm quality to varying degrees. The level of corticosterone had decreased, whereas the level of LH, FSH and testosterone had increased in CRS-treated rats. Moreover, the reduced level of MDA coincided with an increased rate of antioxidant capacity. Our findings suggest that <i>AT</i> extract could alleviate stress-induced dysfunctions.", "Overall, these observations would infer that <i>AT</i> extract could improve fertility capacity and behavioral impairment in the stress conditions.", "Assumption pathway describing the probability underlying mechanism of CRS-induced anxiety and reproductive toxicity and protective effect of AT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, 201583Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bagheri", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, 56947University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fathi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, 201583Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Maghoul", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, 201583Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moshtagh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, 201583Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokhtari", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tabriz Branch, 201583Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdollahpour", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5010-7293"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Medicine Research Center, Biomedicine Institute, 201583Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "These authors are equally contributed to this work."}], "LastName": "Montazersaheb", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Sina Hospital, 56947Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "These authors are equally contributed to this work."}], "LastName": "Bagheri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Achillea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Restraint, Physical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34167364", "10.1177/09603271211026723"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
