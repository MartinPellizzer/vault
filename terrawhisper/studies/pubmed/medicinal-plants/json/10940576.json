Aqueous extracts from these species are used in traditional medicine. In contrast, biological activity and toxicity of these plants are not yet evaluated systematically. The aim of the present work is to investigate a potential anti-inflammatory activity, and to elucidate the toxicity of the extracts. No lethal effects were produced after oral administration of the extracts. The values of the medium lethal doses after intraperitoneal administration were quite high for both species, although A. intermixta seems to be rather more toxic than C. sicyoides. The anti-inflammatory effects have been investigated in two experimental in vivo models. The carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema was chosen as a model for general inflammation, and the mice ear oedema test using tetradecanoylphorbol acetate as inflammatory agent as a model of topical inflammation. Dry extracts from decoctions of A. intermixta leaves and C. sicyoides stems were administered in doses of 300 and 500 mg/kg (p.o.) in the general model, and in doses of 3 and 5 mg/mouse ear for both plants in the topical model. In the general anti-inflammation assay, the oral administration of both extracts produced a significant anti-inflammatory effect, most pronounced for A. intermixta than for C. sicyoides. In the topical model, the administration of both extracts produced similar inhibitions of the oedema, with a reduction of approximately 50% in comparison with the control group. In homogenated tissue samples from the inflamed areas, a distinct decrease in the level of myeloperoxidase enzyme was noted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Seville, 41012, Seville, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu\u00edlez", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1enz", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez-Dom\u00ednguez", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de la Puerta", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agave"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caribbean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10940576", "10.1016/s0378-8741(00)00160-4", "S0378874100001604"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
