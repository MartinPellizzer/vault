A modern diet consisting of the consumption of highly processed foods high in fat, salt and caloric sweeteners and low in fibre is recognised as unhealthy. This study was conducted to assess the penchant of the population for these types of foods rather than traditional indigenous foods known to be healthier. This research was undertaken in the Gauteng region, which is the most urbanized province in the country. This study consisted of a quantitative research survey conducted in 2019 with 1527 participants (Asians, Black, Coloured, Indians and White) aged 18 and above who had lived in the province for at least two years. The results revealed that 30-40\u00a0% were neutral on the issue. Despite half (54.4\u00a0%) indicating that it was good to mix traditional and modern foods, a clear preference for modern food was noticed for 35.7\u00a0% of respondents, with 32.2\u00a0% reporting not being concerned that traditional foods have been replaced by modern foods. The traditional indigenous food consumption (TIFC) appeared to depend on monthly total household income, residential area, and settlement category. Participants with specific economic comfort consumed less. Race and number of people in the participants' households also significantly affected the TIFC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Participants of white ethnicity and those living in a household of a maximum of 02 people displayed the lowest TIFC. In comparison to those who strongly disagree, participants with a neutral opinion about the idea of mixing eating habits were also the most neutral concerning preference for a modern diet (OR: 10.95, 95\u00a0% CI 7.00-17.12) and nutrition transition (OR: 14.66, 95\u00a0% CI 9.09-23.64). Sensitisation about healthy eating habits among the identified at-risk and target groups is undoubtedly a need in the region to avoid a resurgence of modern diet-related diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors.
