The betel powder and various extracts were added to YES broth to determine their effects on the growth and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus. Results showed that betel leaf powder exhibited higher antimycotic activity than fruit. One half percent of ground leaf powder completely inhibited the growth and aflatoxin production by A. parasiticus. Among the solvent extracts, chloroform and ethanol extracts of betel leaf prepared from a single solvent extraction showed more antimycotic activity. The ethanol extract of betel leaf at the level of 450 micrograms/ml would eliminate A. parasiticus growth and aflatoxin production. The antimycotic activity of this ethanol extract was most pronounced at pH 4."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6531413"]}}]}
