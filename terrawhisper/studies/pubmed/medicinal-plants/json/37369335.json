These healthcare systems are among the most well-known, conveniently accessible, and economically priced in India and several other Asian countries. Traditional Indian Ayurvedic plants have the potential to be used as phyto-therapeutics, to create novel anti-asthmatic drugs, and as a cost-effective source of pharmaceuticals. Current conventional therapies have drawbacks, including serious side effects and expensive costs that interfere with treatment compliance and affect the patient's quality of life. The primary objective of the article is to comprehensively evaluate the advancement of research on the protective phytochemicals of traditional plants that target immune responses and signaling cascades in inflammatory experimental asthma models. The study would assist in paving the way for the creation of natural phytomedicines that are protective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory against asthma, which may then be used in individualized asthma therapy.", "The study demonstrates the mechanisms of action of phytochemicals present in traditional medicinal plants, diminish pulmonary disorder in both in vivo and in vitro models of asthma.", "A comprehensive review of the literature on conventional plant-based asthma therapies was performed from 2006 to 2022. The study uses authoritative scientific sources such as PubMed, PubChem Compound, Wiley Online Library, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Google Scholar to collect information on potential phytochemicals and their mechanisms of action. World Flora Online (http://www.worldfloraonline.org) and Plants of the World Online (https://wcsp.science.kew.org) databases were used for the scientific names of medicinal plants.", "The study outlines the phytochemical mechanisms of some traditional Ayurveda botanicals used to treat asthma. Active phytochemicals including curcumin, withaferin-A, piperine, glabridin, glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, trans-cinnamaldehyde, \u03b1-hederin, thymoquinone, eugenol, [6]-shogoal, and gingerol may treat asthma by controlling inflammation and airway remodeling. The study concluded that certain Ayurvedic plants' phytochemicals have the ability to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system, that can effectively cure asthma.", "Plants used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine have been utilized for millennia, advocating phyto-therapy as a treatment for a variety of illnesses. A theoretical foundation for the use of cutting-edge asthma treatments has been built with the growth of experimental research on traditional phytochemicals. In-depth phytochemical research for the treatment of asthma using Indian Traditional Ayurvedic herbs is compiled in the study. The approach for preventative therapeutics and cutting-edge alternatives to battle the molecular pathways in the pathophysiology of asthma are the key themes of the study. The phytochemical mechanism of action of traditional Ayurvedic herbs is explained to get the attention of the pharmaceutical industry so they can make future anti-asthma drugs for personalized asthma care in the community. The study develops strategies for customized phyto-therapeutics, concentrating on low-cost, side-effect-free approaches that employ bioactive phytochemicals from plants as the major source of effective anti-asthmatic therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
