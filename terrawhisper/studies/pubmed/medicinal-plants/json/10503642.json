The differences of growth rates and artemisinin contents among the 7 selected hairy root lines were extremely significant, of which HR-9 gave the highest yield of artemisinin, reaching 33.25 mg/y.L. The differences of growth rates and artemisinin contents among hairy roots, untransformated roots and callus were also significant. There were no obvious lag phase in batch culture of hairy roots of Artemisia annua L. The exponential growth phase was 7 approximately 15 days after inculation. The growth rate reached the highest on the 11th day, and the cultures reached a stationary phase on the 20th day. The properties of artemisinin content of hairy roots were obviously \"related to growth\". The artemisinin content decreased slowly during the exponential phase, increased while the growth rate slowed down and remained consistent after the growth stopped. The optimum culture time for hairy roots of Artemisia annua L. was 21 days in our system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9100855", "ISSNLinking": "1042-749X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10503642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
