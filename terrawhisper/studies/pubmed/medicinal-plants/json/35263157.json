It has been planted in Pingli County (109.35 E, 32.39 N), Ankang, Shaanxi province, China for a long history with more than 3000 ha per year. In April 2021, typical root-knot nematode disease symptoms, stunting and galled roots with massive egg masses, were observed on local G. pentaphyllum plants in several gardens. Meloidogyne females and egg masses were dissected from the infected roots. The female was spherical in body shape with a project neck; the excretory pore was at level of or posterior to stylet knobs, 10-20 annules behind head; the perineal pattern had a high dorsal arch, sometimes square or trapezoidal in shape, without obvious lateral lines. The male head was not offset with body, head cap was of stepped outline and concaved at center of top end in lateral view; stylet knobs were prominent, usually demarcated from shaft. Morphological measurements of females (n=20) were: body length (L)= 851.78 \u00b1 83.55 \u00b5m (700.15 \u00b5m to 986.48 \u00b5m); maximum body width (W)= 633.11 \u00b1 71.69 \u00b5m (453.09 \u00b5m to 746.31 \u00b5m); stylet length (ST)= 14.81 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5m (13.31 \u00b5m to 15.76 \u00b5m); stylet knob height (STKH)= 1.54 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m (1.45 \u00b5m to 1.81 \u00b5m); stylet knob width (STKW)= 3.61 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5m (3.38 \u00b5m to 3.87 \u00b5m); and distance from dorsal esophageal gland opening to the stylet (DGO)= 3.56 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5m (3.28 \u00b5m to 4.90 \u00b5m). Measurements of males (n=20) were: L=1756.96 \u00b1 67.81 \u00b5m (1643.58 \u00b5m to 1862.14 \u00b5m); W=55.37 \u00b1 1.28 \u00b5m (53.46 \u00b5m to 57.66 \u00b5m); ST= 22.75 \u00b1 1.05\u00b5m (19.14 \u00b5m to 24.88 \u00b5m); STKH= 2.59 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5m (2.45 \u00b5m to 2.72 \u00b5m); STKW= 3.66 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5m (3.27 \u00b5m to 3.91 \u00b5m); and DGO= 3.52 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5m (3.38 \u00b5m to 4.72 \u00b5m). Measurements of second-stage juveniles (J2) (n=20) were: L= 418.99 \u00b1 22.04 \u00b5m (376.89 \u00b5m to 450.66 \u00b5m); W= 14.77 \u00b1 1.15 \u00b5m (13.03 \u00b5m to 17.77 \u00b5m); ST= 12.84 \u00b1 0.45\u00b5m (12.05 \u00b5m to 13.75 \u00b5m); STKH= 1.44 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5m (1.14 \u00b5m to 1.71 \u00b5m); STKW= 2.25 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b5m (1.81 \u00b5m to 2.76 \u00b5m); and DGO= 1.81 \u00b1 0.31 \u00b5m (0.38 \u00b5m to 2.56 \u00b5m). The morphological characteristics of this nematode were consistent with Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White, 1919) Chitwood, 1949 (Williams, 1973; Eisenback and Hirschmann, 1981). Identification was further confirmed with DNA extracted from 20 individual females. Part of the rDNA spanning internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1, 5.8S gene, and ITS2 was amplified with the pair of primers: rDNA-F/R (TTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTT/TTTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG) (Vrain et al., 1992). A 768 bp fragment (GenBank Accession No. MZ613806) was obtained, showing 100% identical (768 bp to 768 bp) to the known sequences of M. incognita (GenBank Accession Nos. MH113856, KC464469, and MT921010). Species identification was also confirmed by amplifying part of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) from mitochondrial DNA with primers: NAD5-F/R (TATTTTTTGTTTGAGATATATTAG/CGTGAATCTTGATTTTCCATTTTT) (Janssen et al., 2016). The resulting 611 bp fragment was deposited in GenBank with Accession No. MZ613807. The fragment showed a highest identity of 99.67% (601 bp out of 611 bp) with sequences from other M. incognita isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. MW759707, MW759706, MW759705). Based on both morphological and molecular data, the root-knot nematode from G. pentaphyllum was identified as M. incognita. A pathogenicity test was carried out by inoculating 1500 J2 hatched from the egg masses dissected from the diseased roots to a 4-weeks-old healthy G. pentaphyllum seedling cultured in sterilized sandy soil in pot, 15 plants were inoculated and 5 non-inoculated plants served as controls. After maintained at 25\u00b0C for 6 weeks, all of the inoculated plant roots showed galling symptoms which were similar to those observed in the field. Nematodes were collected from root and soil, and an average reproduction factor value of 3.51 was obtained. While no galls were observed on the control plants. For further confirmation, all egg masses dissected from inoculated plants were identified to be M. incognita with its sequence specific primers Mi-F/Mi-R (GGGCAAGTAAGGATGCTCTGAC/CTTTCATAGCCACGTCGCGATC) (Ray et al., 1994). In this study, G. pentaphyllum has been identified as a new host of M. incognita, hence the occurrence status and control of root-knot disease on G. pentaphyllum caused by this pathogen would be new problems in production and need further study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; changq@xab.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ankang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Ankang, Shaanxi, China; qinjianfeng3321@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; yangyiwei05@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yiwei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xi'an, China; 545141529@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, West Yuanmingyuan Road No.2,, Beijing, China, 100193; dlpeng@ippcaas.cn."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Deliang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; liym@xab.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "YingMei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35263157", "10.1094/PDIS-08-21-1602-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
