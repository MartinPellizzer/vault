Age-associated neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by alpha-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic neuron resulting in neurodegeneration. The invention of bioactive molecules that delay aging and age-associated disorders endorses development of natural phytomolecule as a therapeutic agent for curing age-related diseases. Therefore, the present study for the first time explores the potential of SIV against aging and Parkinsonism utilising Caenorhabditis elegans model system. SIV significantly attenuated oxidative stress in terms of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as oxidative damage including protein carbonylation and also promotes longevity. SIV also significantly increased the mRNA expression of stress responsive genes namely sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, gst-4, gst-7 and ctl-2 suggesting its anti-oxidant property that might be contributed in the modulation of oxidative stress and promoting lifespan. Additionally, SIV improved PD symptoms by reducing the alpha-synuclein aggregation, lipid accumulation and enhancing dopamine level. Altogether, present findings indicate that SIV possibly utilising ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal system and attenuating oxidative stress by up-regulating PD-associated genes pdr-1, ubc-12 and pink-1. Therefore, this study is a forward step in exploring the anti-aging and anti-Parkinsonism potential of bioactive compound SIV in C. elegans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Aging Biology, Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology , Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Smita", "ForeName": "Shachi Shuchi", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Aging Biology, Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology , Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Raj Sammi", "ForeName": "Shreesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Division , Central Drug Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Laxman", "ForeName": "Tulsankar S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Division , Central Drug Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Bhatta", "ForeName": "Rabi S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Aging Biology, Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology , Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asparagus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Parkinsonian Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29069955", "10.1080/10715762.2017.1395419"]}}]}
