However, the metabolic regulatory mechanism of low-N-induced triterpenoid saponin and flavonoid accumulation in rhizomatous medicinal Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen remains unclear.", "To explore the potential regulatory mechanism and metabolic basis controlling the response of P. notoginseng to N deficiency, the transcriptome and metabolome were analysed in the roots.", "The N content was significantly reduced in roots of N<sub>0</sub>-treated P. notoginseng (0\u00a0kg\u00b7N\u00b7667\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>). The C/N ratio was enhanced in the N-deficient P. notoginseng. N deficiency promotes the accumulation of amino acids (L-proline, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-norleucine, L-arginine, and L-citrulline) and sugar (arabinose, xylose, glucose, fructose, and mannose), thus providing precursor metabolites for the biosynthesis of flavonoids and triterpenoid saponins. Downregulation of key structural genes (PAL, PAL3, ACC1, CHS2, PPO, CHI3, F3H, DFR, and FGT), in particular with the key genes of F3H, involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway possibly induced the decrease in flavonoid content with increased N supply. Notoginsenoside R<sub>1</sub>, ginsenoside Re, Rg<sub>1</sub>, Rd, F<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0Rg<sub>1</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0Rb<sub>1</sub> and total triterpenoid saponins were enhanced in the N<sub>0</sub> groups than in the N<sub>15</sub> (15\u00a0kg\u00b7N\u00b7667\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>) plants. Higher phosphoenolpyruvate (an intermediate of glycolyticwith pathway metabolism) and serine (an intermediate of photorespiration) levels induced by N deficiency possibly promote saponin biosynthesis through mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol (MEP) pathways. Genes (MVD2, HMGS, HMGR1, HMGR2, DXR, and HMGR1) encoding the primary enzymes HMGS, HMGR, DXR, and MVD in the MVA and MEP pathways were significantly upregulated in the N<sub>0</sub>-treated P. notoginseng. The saponin biosynthesis genes DDS, DDS, CYP716A52, CYP716A47, UGT74AE2, and FPS were upregulated in the N-deficient plants. Upregulation of genes involved in saponin biosynthesis promotes the accumulation of triterpenoid saponins in the N<sub>0</sub>-grown P. notoginseng.", "N deficiency enhances primary metabolisms, such as amino acids and sugar accumulation, laying the foundation for the synthesis of flavonoids and triterpenoid saponins in P. notoginseng. F3H, DDS, FPS, HMGR, HMGS and UGT74AE2 can be considered as candidates for functional characterisation of the N-regulated accumulation of triterpenoid saponins and flavonoids in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
