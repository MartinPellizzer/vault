Soyasaponins, commonly derived from legumes, are a class of triterpenoid saponins that demonstrate significant potential for plant and human health applications. Previous research and reviews largely emphasize human health effects of soyasaponins. However, the biological effects of soyasaponins and their implications for plants in the context of human health have not been well-discussed. This review provides comprehensive discussions on the biological roles of soyasaponins in plant defense and rhizosphere microbial interactions; biosynthetic regulation and compound production; immunological effects and potential for therapeutics; and soyasaponin acquisition attributed to processing effects, bioavailability, and biotransformation processes based on recent soyasaponin research. Given the multifaceted biological effects elicited by soyasaponins, further research warrants an integrated approach to understand molecular mechanisms of regulations in their production as well as their applications in plant and human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina 28262, United States."}], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "Ping S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina 28262, United States."}], "LastName": "Roberson", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina 28262, United States."}], "LastName": "Ramsue", "ForeName": "Lyric K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3537-7783"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina 28262, United States."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Bao-Hua", "Initials": "BH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34843230", "10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04819"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
