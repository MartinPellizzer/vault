However, the tumor suppressor function of p53 is effectively inhibited by its direct interaction with the hydrophobic cleft of MDM2 protein via multiple mechanisms As a result, restoring p53 activity by blocking the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction has been proposed as a compelling therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The use of molecular docking and phytochemical screening procedures are appraised to inhibit MDM2's hydrophobic cleft and disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction. For this purpose, a library of 51 bioactive compounds from 10 medicinal plants was compiled and subjected to structure-based virtual screening. Out of these, only 3 compounds (Atalantoflavone, Cudraxanthone 1, and Ursolic acid) emerged as promising inhibitors of MDM2-p53 based on their binding affinities (-9.1\u2009kcal/mol, -8.8\u2009kcal/mol, and -8.8\u2009kcal/mol respectively) when compared to the standard (-8.8\u2009kcal/mol). Moreover, these compounds showed better pharmacokinetic and drug-like profiling than the standard inhibitor (Chromonotriazolopyrimidine 1). Finally, the 100\u2009ns MD simulation analysis confirmed no significant perturbation in the conformational dynamics of the simulated binary complexes when compared to the standard. In particular, Ursolic acid was found to satisfy the molecular enumeration the most compared to the other inhibitors. Our overall molecular modeling finding shows why these compounds may emerge as potent arsenals for cancer therapeutics. Nonetheless, extensive experimental and clinical research is needed to augment their use in clinics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
