This review presents recently published information from various databases regarding TM, especially herbal drugs, and its integration with Western medical practices outside and inside Vietnam. We first discuss the integration of traditional and modem health concepts by Vietnamese immigrants living outside Vietnam. Next, we describe native and emigrated health education and practices of pharmacy students, health professionals, and citizens living in Vietnam. Finally, we report the recent biological validation of medicinal plants and non-herbal therapies emerging from Vietnamese TM and their current and potential medical uses as identified by Western approaches. The main example described here involves utilization of the tree Artocarpus tonkinensis by the ethnic minority of Black Hmong in northern Vietnam, who use a decoction of its leaves to treat arthritis and backache without apparent adverse effects. Our comprehensive review emphasizes that, although Vietnam has a very rich collection of TM practices (particularly the use of herbal drugs), these therapies should be biologically and clinically validated with modem Western methods for optimal integration of Western and traditional medicine in global populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adorisio", "ForeName": "Sabrina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fierabracci", "ForeName": "Alessandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rossetto", "ForeName": "Ariele", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muscari", "ForeName": "Isabella", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nardicchi", "ForeName": "Vincenza", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liberati", "ForeName": "Anna Marina", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Riccardi", "ForeName": "Carlo", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Sung", "ForeName": "Tran", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thuy", "ForeName": "Trinh Thy", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Delfino", "ForeName": "Domenico V", "Initials": "DV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30807048"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
