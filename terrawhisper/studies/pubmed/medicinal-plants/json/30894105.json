Urease a nickel containing metalloenzyme found in bacteria, algae, fungi, and plants brings hydrolysis of urea and plays important role in environmental nitrogen cycle. Apart from this it was found to be responsible for many pathological conditions due to its presence in many microorganisms such as H. Pylori, a ureolytic bacteria having urease which elevates pH of gastric medium by hydrolyzing urea present in alimentary canal and help the bacteria to colonize and spread infection. Due to the infections caused by the various bacterial ureases such as Bacillus pasteurii, Brucella abortus, H. pylori, H. mustelae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas putida, Sporosarcina pasteurii and Yersinia enterocolitica, it has been the current topic of today's research. About a wide range of compounds from the exhaustive literature survey has been discussed in this review which is enveloped into two expansive classes, as Inhibitors from synthetic origin and Inhibitors from natural origin. Moreover active site details of enzyme, mechanism of catalysis of substrate by enzyme, uses of plant urease and its pathogenic behavior has been included in the current review. So, overall, this review article diagrams the current landscape of the developments in the improvements in the thriving field of urease inhibitory movement in medicinal chemistry from year 2010 to 2018, with an emphasis on mechanism of action of inhibitors that may be used for more development of recent and strong urease inhibitors and open up new doors for assist examinations in a standout amongst the most lively and promising regions of research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sonepat, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Kataria", "ForeName": "Ritu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Khatkar", "ForeName": "Anurag", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Protein Pept Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100960529", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2037"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30894105", "10.2174/1389203720666190320170215", "CPPS-EPUB-97477"]}}]}
