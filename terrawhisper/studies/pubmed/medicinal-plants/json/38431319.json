The potential regulations of AI-2 quorum sensing (QS) system and activated methyl cycle (AMC) were studied by analyzing the supplementation roles of key circulating substances mediated via luxS, including S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), methionine (Met), homocysteine (Hcy) and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). Growth experiments revealed that the luxS deletion led to certain growth limitations of SHP, which were associated with culture medium and exogenous additives. Meanwhile, the decreased biofilm formation and diminished hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production capacity of SHP were observed after luxS deletion. The relatively lower total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) contents and higher sensory scores of fish homogenate with luxS mutant strain inoculation also indicated the weaker spoilage-inducing effects after luxS deletion. However, these deficiencies could be offset with the exogenous supply of circulating substances mentioned above. Our findings suggested that the luxS deletion would reduce the spoilage ability of SHP, which was potentially attributed to the disorder of AMC and AI-2 QS system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
