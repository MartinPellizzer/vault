Frankincense resin has over the years been employed to treat depression, inflammation, and cancer in traditional medicines.", "This inclusive review focuses on the significance of frankincense diterpenoids, and in particular, incensole derivatives for establishment future treatments of depression, neurological disorders, and cancer. The authors survey the available literature and furnish an overview of future perspectives of these intriguing molecules.", "Numerous diterpenoids including cembrane, prenylaromadendrane, and the verticillane-type have been isolated from various <i>Boswellia</i> resins. Cembrane-type diterpenoids occupy a crucial position in pharmaceutical chemistry and related industries because of their intriguing biological and encouraging pharmacological potentials. Several cembranes have been reported to possess anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antimalarial effects along with a good possibility to treat anxiety and depression. Although some slight drawbacks of these compounds have been noted, including the selectivity of these diterpenoids, there is a great need to address these in future research endeavors. Moreover, it is vitally important for medicinal chemists to prepare libraries of incensole-heterocyclic analogs as well as hybrid compounds between incensole or its acetate and anti-depressant or anti-inflammatory drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Halle, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Division, Research Center, Dhofar University, Salalah, Oman."}], "LastName": "Rashan", "ForeName": "Luay", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Uzma", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Capital University of Science & Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Muzaffar", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, USA."}], "LastName": "Hakkim", "ForeName": "Faruck L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Ivan R", "Initials": "IR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101295755", "ISSNLinking": "1746-0441"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R9XLF1R1WM", "NameOfSubstance": "Frankincense"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boswellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Frankincense"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35243948", "10.1080/17460441.2022.2044782"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
