Male Wistar rats were randomly selected to establish hydronephrosis rat model, after which all rats were classified into normal, model, negative control (NC), siRNA-SOCS-1, siRNA-SOCS-3, and siRNA-SOCS-1\u2009+\u2009siRNA-SOCS-3 groups. The levels of urine protein, serum creatinine (Scr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were detected. ELISA was performed to determine levels of cystatin (CysC), \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used for mRNA and protein expressions of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-\u03b21. Compared with the normal group, the levels of Scr, BUN, urine protein, NAG, CysC, \u03b22-MG, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased in other groups, as well as elevated mRNA and protein expressions of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, \u03b1-SMA, and TGF-\u03b21. The siRNA-SOCS-1, siRNA-SOCS-3, and siRNA-SOCS-1\u2009+\u2009siRNA-SOCS-3 groups were found with decreased levels of Scr, BUN, urine protein, NAG, CysC, \u03b22-MG, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, as well as mRNA and protein expressions of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, \u03b1-SMA, and TGF-\u03b21, including positive rates of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 proteins in comparison with the model and NC groups. In comparison with the siRNA-SOCS-1 and siRNA-SOCS-3 groups, the siRNA-SOCS-1\u2009+\u2009siRNA-SOCS-3 group exhibited decreased levels of Scr, BUN, urine protein, NAG, CysC, \u03b22-MG, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1.
