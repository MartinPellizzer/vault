However, in vermiculite medium, the effect of fungus AR-18 on fresh weight of D. nobile was significant (P < 0.05). Fresh weight of D. nobile inoculated with fungus AR-18 was increased by 16% compared with the non-inoculated ones (control). The effect of fungus AR-18 on dry weight of D. nobile was very significant (P < 0.01). Dry weight of D. nobile inoculated with fungus AR-18 was increased by 21% compared with the control. In vermiculite medium, the effect of combination treatment (Fungus AR-18 + Distilled H2O) on fresh weight of D. nobile was very significant (P < 0.01). Fresh weight of D. nobile inoculated with fungus AR-18 was increased by 47% compared with the control, while the effect of combination treatment (Fungus AR-18 + Nutrients) on fresh weight of D. nobile was not significant (P > 0.05). In addition, the effect of combinations treatment (Fungus AR-18 + Nutrients) and (Fungus AR-18 + Distilled H2O) on dry weight of D. nobile was not significant (P > 0.05). So the combination treatment (Fungus AR-18 + Distilled H2O) was the best for the growth of D. nobile. In vermiculite medium, effects of fungus AR-18 and nutrients on fresh weight and dry weight of D. candidum were not significant (P > 0.05).", "It is important in vitro culture to select a proper rest for the control of the growth of fungus to establish a beneficial symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. If the fungus AR-18 is utilized as biological manure in got-up planting of D. nobile, a good result may be obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mycology, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, CAMS, PUMC, Beijing 100094, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "S X", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8006230", "ISSNLinking": "1000-503X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agar"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12901095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
