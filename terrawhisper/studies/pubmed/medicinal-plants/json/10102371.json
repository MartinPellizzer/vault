A single fragment was amplified from all the accessions with each of 12 sequence-tagged microsatellite site markers, except for one locus where no fragment was obtained from either of the two wild species. There was a high degree of intraspecific polymorphism at these microsatellite loci, although isozymes, conventional RFLPs and RAPDs show very little or no polymorphism. Overall, the repeat number at a locus (excluding null alleles) ranged from 7 to 42. The average number of alleles per locus was 14.1 and the average genetic diversity was 0.86. Based on the estimates obtained, 11 out of the 12 frequency distributions of alleles at the loci tested can be considered to be non-normal. A significant positive correlation between the average number of repeats (size of the locus) and the amount of variation was observed, indicating that replication slippage may be the molecular mechanism involved in generation of variability at the loci. A comparison between the infinite allele and stepwise mutation models revealed that for 11 out of the 12 loci the number of alleles observed fell in between the values predicted by the two models. Phylogenetic analysis of microsatellite polymorphism in C. arietinum showed no relationship between accession and geographic origin, which is compatible with the recent expansion of this crop throughout the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, Aleppo, Syria.
