Pers. of family Papaveraceae are rich in multiple alkaloids and widely used as Chinese medicinal herbs, for treating cough, pruritus, sores tinea and snake venom (Zhang et al. 2008, Iranshahy et al. 2014). In April 2021, orange rust pustules were observed on <i>C. acuminata</i>, <i>C. edulis</i> and <i>C. racemosa</i> in Shaanxi Province (34\u00b04'56'' N, 108\u00b02'9'' E, alt. 770 m), China. Samples were collected and voucher specimens were preserved in the Herbarium Mycologicum Academiae Sinicae (nos. HMAS249947-HMAS249949), China. Consequent geospatial investigations revealed that diseased plants can be observed at an altitude of 400-1000 m, and show an incidence from 40% to 80% varied by altitude. Spermogonia epiphyllous, subcuticular, densely grouped, oval or round, 0.14-0.36 \u00d7 0.09-0.30 mm, pale orange-yellow, and type 3 of Cummins and Hiratsuka (1963). Aecia mostly hypophyllous, subepidermal without peridia, Caeoma-type, erumpent, densely grouped, oval or round, 0.27-0.85 \u00d7 0.15-0.43 mm, and orange-yellow; hyaline peridial cells produced in a periphery of the sorus under the ruptured epidermis of host plants. Aeciospores globoid or broadly ellipsoid, catenulate with intercalary cells, 15.7-20.1 \u00d7 10.8-15.7 \u03bcm, yellow to pale orange; walls hyaline, verrucose, 1.7-3.1 \u03bcm thick. This fungus was morphologically identified as <i>Melampsora</i> (Melampsoraceae). The rDNA-28S and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were amplified using primers NL1/NL4 and ITS1/ITS4 (Ji et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020). Bi-directional sequences were assembled and deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MW990091-MW990093 and MW996576-MW996578). Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the ITS+rDNA-28S dataset based on maximum-likelihood (ML), maximum-parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI). ML and MP bootstrap values were calculated by bootstrap analyses of 1,000 replicates using MEGA-X (Kumar et al. 2018), while BI posterior probabilities (Bpps) were calculated using MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 (Ji et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020). Phylogenetic analyses grouped our specimens and <i>Melampsora ferrinii</i> Toome & Aime into one clade, highly supported by bootstrap values of ML, MP, and Bpps of 100%/100%/1. Inoculations were conducted with 1-year-old plants of original host, <i>Salix babylonica</i> L. (Toome & Aime 2015). Aeciospores suspension with a concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml were sprayed on 20 healthy leaves, with another 20 healthy leaves sprayed with sterile water as the control. The inoculated plants were kept in darkness at 20-25 \u00b0C for 2 days and then transferred into greenhouse at 23\u00b0C with 16 h light per day. After 8-10 days of inoculation, yellow pustules of uredinia appeared on abaxial surfaces of the inoculated leaves, which were identical to Toome & Aime (2015) reported, while the control leaves remained healthy. Inoculations with the same method were conducted by spraying urediniospores, and the same rust symptoms developed after 8 days. Genus <i>Corydalis</i> was verified as the alternate host of <i>M. chelidonii-pierotii</i> Tak. Matsumoto, <i>M. coleosporioides</i> Dietel, <i>M. idesiae</i> Miyabe and <i>M. yezoensis</i> Miyabe & T. Matsumoto (Shinyama & Yamaoka 2012; Okane et al. 2014; Yamaoka & Okane 2019), and <i>C. incisa</i> (Thunb.) Pers. was speculated as the potential alternate host of <i>M. ferrinii</i> (Toome & Aime 2015). Based on morphology, phylogeny and pathogenicity, we firstly report <i>M. ferrinii</i> in mainland China and verify <i>C. acuminata</i>, <i>C. edulis</i> and <i>C. racemosa</i> instead of <i>C. incisa</i> as its alternate hosts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Taicheng Road 3#, Yangling, Shaanxi, China, 712100; jeremy0704@nwafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Zijia", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; xiongchaowei@nwafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Chaowei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; luozeyu@nwsuaf.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zeyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; hxy2018@nwafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiangyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, Forestry College, Taicheng Road 3#, Yangling, Shaanxi, China, 712100; yuzhongdong001@nwsuaf.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhongdong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, 12381, Institute of Botany, No.20 Nanxincun, Xiangshan, Beijing, Beijing, Beijing, China, 100093; chentx@ibcas.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tianxiang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; xuyong@nwafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, 12469, College of Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; wangbin2019@nwafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["34232054", "10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0958-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
