The IC50 was about 3.5 mg/ml. In addition, HHT inhibited also the aggregation induced by ADP, A23187 or arachidonate in PRP. Greater inhibition was observed in the preparation of washed platelets. Increase of the calcium concentration in medium could not overcome the inhibitory effect of HHT. ATP release from platelets induced by collagen or A23187 was inhibited by HHT. In the presence of EDTA, ATP release caused by thrombin or A23187 was also inhibited by HHT. Malondialdehyde and thromboxane B2 formation was greatly inhibited by HHT in platelets challenged by collagen and thrombin. In arachidonate-stimulated platelets, thromboxane B2, but not malondialdehyde formation was inhibited. HHT showed more marked inhibition on aggregation in the presence of indomethacin, creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase or a combination of both. Hydrogen peroxide-induced hemolysis was marked reduced by HHT. It was concluded that HHT might have some membrane-active properties which interfered with the activation of phospholipase A2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YG812J1I", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37H9VM9WZL", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcimycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcimycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3927704", "10.1142/S0192415X85000150", "S0192415X85000150"]}}]}
