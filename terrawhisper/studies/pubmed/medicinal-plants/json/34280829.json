Traditionally ashwagandha is used to treat several neurological disorders. This study evaluates the cytotoxic, apoptotic, antiangiogenic and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory activity of W. somnifera on lung adenocarcinoma.", "Aqueous and ethanolic extracts were prepared from the roots of the W. somnifera. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses were performed using the standard protocols. Cytotoxicity was assessed using MTT assay. Further experiments were carried out with IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of the extract. Apoptosis and DNA damage were evaluated using AO-EB dual staining, Hoechst staining and Comet assay. Effect of the extract on cell migration was evaluated using scratch assay. Angiogenesis inhibition was evaluated using in ovo CAM assay and angiogenic pathway alterations were evaluated using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Autophagy induction was studied via western blotting.", "In this study, we found antioxidant activity and the presence of certain secondary metabolites in the ethanolic extracts. The extract showed cytotoxic activity on lung adenocarcinoma cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 99.7\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The extract showed significant anti-angiogenic, apoptotic and autophagy induction activity. W. somnifera extract induced significant decrease in the cell migration at lower concentrations indicating the anti-migratory potential.", "Our investigation revealed ethanolic extract of W. somnifera possess significant anti-angiogenic and MMP inhibitory activity and helps in inhibiting the lung adenocarcinoma cells proliferation. Further, our study revealed that the enhanced autophagy induction and apoptotic effects of W. somnifera are responsible for the potential anticancer activity of the extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
