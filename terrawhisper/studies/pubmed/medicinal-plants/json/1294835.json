A new method was developed for the detection and quantitation of cocaine and its metabolites, BZE and EME, from hair in a single procedure. The hair samples were washed, cut into 56 segments (2-cm length), pulverized, and incubated with phosphate buffer and the enzyme beta-glucuronidase-arylsulfatase. After solid phase extraction and derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride/pentafluoropropanol, the drugs were identified and measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using deuterated cocaine, BZE, and EME as internal standards. The method is reproducible (cocaine, CV = 8%; BZE, CV = 14%) and the detection limit for cocaine and BZE was 0.1 ng/mg, for EME 1 ng/mg. In the different hair segments, cocaine was found to be present in concentrations between 1.4 to 50.6 ng/mg, benzoylecgonine from 0.4 to 17.6 ng/mg, and ecgonine methyl ester traces below the calibration curve of approximately 12.9 ng/mg. In 95% of the cases cocaine exceeded BZE and EME in concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Legal Medicine, State University of Saarland, Homburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "M\u00f6ller", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fey", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rimbach", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Anal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705085", "ISSNLinking": "0146-4760"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5353I8I6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "benzoylecgonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I5Y540LHVR", "NameOfSubstance": "Cocaine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y35FJB3QBJ", "NameOfSubstance": "ecgonine methyl ester"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cocaine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Abuse Detection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1294835", "10.1093/jat/16.5.291"]}}]}
