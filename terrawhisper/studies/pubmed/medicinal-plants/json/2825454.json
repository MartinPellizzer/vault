The form isolated from S. trifasciata has the molecular weight of about 115,000. The apparent molecular weights for the two forms from mung bean were approximately 220,000 and 450,000. All three forms have the same pH optima, an absolute requirement for Mg2+ ions both in the forward and reverse reaction, but differ in their sensitivity toward fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Kinetic properties of the partially purified enzymes have been investigated in the presence and absence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase from S. trifasciata exhibited hyperbolic kinetics with all substrates tested. The saturation curves of the enzyme (form A) from mung bean for pyrophosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were sigmoidal in the absence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate these kinetics became hyperbolic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biology, Toru\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kowalczyk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biochim Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "14520300R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-527X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79082-92-1", "NameOfSubstance": "fructose 2,6-diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.90", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2825454"]}}]}
