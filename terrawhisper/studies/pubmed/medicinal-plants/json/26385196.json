It belongs to the notoriously toxic family Araceae giving it, through association, a reputation for being toxic; despite little or no systematic evidence exists to support this claim. As an ancient plant it has sustained substantial climate changes and attacks from millions of generations of pathogenic microorganisms, which encouraged search for novel natural products from this source. Seven natural products have been characterized from leaves and petioles of Z. zamiifolia, including the novel main compound of the leaves, apigenin 6-C-(6\u2033-(3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaroyl)-\u00df-glucopyranoside). The structure determinations were based on extensive use of 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Initial toxicological experiment on extracts from Z. zamiifolia using brine shrimp lethality assay did not indicate lethality to the shrimps providing disproving evidence for the assumption of Z. zamiifolia's toxic character."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
