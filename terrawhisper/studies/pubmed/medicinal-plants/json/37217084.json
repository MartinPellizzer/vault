However, R2R3-MYBs in patchouli have not been systematically investigated. Here, based on the gene annotation of patchouli genome sequence, 484 R2R3-MYB transcripts were detected. Further in-depth analysis of the gene structure and expression of R2R3-MYBs supported the tetraploid hybrid origin of patchouli. When combined with R2R3-MYBs from Arabidopsis, a phylogenetic tree of patchouli R2R3-MYBs was constructed and divided into 31 clades. Interestingly, a patchouli-specific R2R3-MYB clade was found and confirmed by homologous from other Lamiaceae species. The syntenic analysis demonstrated that tandem duplication contributed to its evolution. This study systematically analysed the R2R3-MYB family in patchouli, providing information on its gene characterization, functional prediction, and species evolution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
