On HepG2 cells Insulin EC<sub>50</sub> of 93 \u00b1 21nM decreased to 13 \u00b1 2nM in the presence of the flavonoids mixture from A.cominia. In L6 cells, insulin also produced a concentration-dependent increase with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 28.6 \u00b1 0.7nM; EC<sub>50</sub> decreased to 0.08 \u00b1 0.02nM and 5 \u00b1 0.9nM in the presence of 100\u03bcg/ml of flavonoids and pheophytins mixtures, respectively. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, insulin had an EC<sub>50</sub> of >1000nM that decreased to 38 \u00b1 4nM in the presence of the flavonoids extract. However, in adipocytes, insulin produced a significant concentration-dependent increase and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 30 \u00b1 8nM was a further confirmation of the insulin responsiveness of the adipocytes to the insulin. At 100\u00b5g/ml, flavonoids and pheophytins extracts decreased fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by two folds in comparison to the control differentiated cells (p < 0.05). The crude extract of A. cominia did not show any enhancement of 2-NBDG uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the presence or absence of 100nM insulin. In addition, in fully differentiated adipocytes, both extracts produced significant decrease in lipid droplets in the cells and no lipid accumulation were seen after withdrawal of the extracts from the cell growth medium. However, there was no effect of both extracts on total protein concentration in cells as well as on Glut-4 transporters.", "the pharmacological effects of the extracts from A. cominia observed in experimental diabetic models were shown in this study.
