Since Toki has been frequently used as a crude drug in traditional Chinese formulations, the stable supply and quality of Toki are essential issues in Japanese clinical practice. To clarify the historical and present conditions of Toki, a historical survey on herbal books and a field investigation on the cultivation condition of A. acutiloba in the Fuki area (Wakayama Prefecture) were carried out. From the present historical survey, it was proven that Yamato-Toki produced in the Yamato area, an old local area including the current Nara and Wakayama prefectures in Japan, had been considered to be superior merchandise. It was also proven that a special processing method to prevent flower stalk growth (\"Mekuri\" in Japanese) is an original method different from Chinese methods. From the present field investigation, it was also proven that the traditional transplant operation of the second year has been handed down since the 1930s and that washing roots in hot water (\"Yumomi\" in Japanese) is an original method of preparing Yamato-Toki. Toki is one of the precious crude drugs cultivated and prepared in Japan. The present study may help to pass on traditional cultivation culture and contribute to an expansion in the volume of Yamato-Toki produced in Japan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Kinki University, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuda", "ForeName": "Kozo", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "Kazuya", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "Hideaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tani", "ForeName": "Tadato", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Angelica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20527290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
