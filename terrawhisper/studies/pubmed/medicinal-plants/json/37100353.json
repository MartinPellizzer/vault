The structures of the new compounds were identified by extensive application of spectroscopic methods, including <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, IR and HR-ESI-MS. All compounds, except for compounds 3-5, 9 and 10 were isolated for the first time from S. parviflora. Their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities were evaluated for the first time by the PNPG method. Three compounds (1, 7 and 10) exhibited marked activities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 104 to 324\u00a0\u03bcM, and their structure-activity relationship is preliminarily discussed herein."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
