The current study aimed to detect and evaluate lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD as well as the potential efficiency of methanolic extract of Eclipta prostrata (E. prostrata) on disease management. In this study, Phytochemical screening of E. prostrata methanolic extract was performed using HPLC. NAFLD was induced in albino rats using a high-fat diet together with cholesterol and cholic acid. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses on sera from rats bearing NAFLD as well as normal healthy animals were carried out based on GCMS and multivariate data analysis. The results showed that high doses (300&200\u202fmg/kg.BW) of E. prostrata extract exhibited significant improvement in liver enzymes (ALT & AST) and lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerides (TAGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)] in rats bearing NAFLD. Glycerol, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and cholest-5-en-3-ol (3\u03b2) acetate were detected as lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD in rats' sera. Furthermore, E. prostrata extract showed a significant amelioration in the levels of these metabolic biomarkers in both protective and treated groups. These finding devoutly recommend using of lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD and E. prostrata could be used as a protective agent as well as ameliorate this disease through its probable action on the fore-mentioned metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
