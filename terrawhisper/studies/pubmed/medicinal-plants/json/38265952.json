This is the first report on the <sup>13</sup>C NMR assignments for <i>epi</i>-magnolin (<b>3</b>). Each of the isolated compounds was evaluated for its ability to inhibit MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line. Among them, <i>epi</i>-magnolin (<b>3</b>) displayed potential activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29\u2009nM) compared to colchicine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 56\u2009nM). 3D-flexible alignment revealed that <i>epi</i>-magnolin (<b>3</b>) has great matching with the tubulin polymerization inhibitor, colchicine. Meanwhile, docking studies exhibited that compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> displayed good binding free energies against colchicine binding site (CBS) of tubulin with binding modes that were highly comparable to that of colchicine. Compounds <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b> showed superior binding free energies than colchicine (-24.37\u2009kcal/mol). <i>epi</i>-Magnolin (<b>3</b>) showed the highest binding score against CBS. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability of <i>epi</i>-magnolin (<b>3</b>) in the active site for 200\u2009ns. Furthermore, four online servers (Swiss ADME, pkCSM pharmacokinetics, AdmetSAR, and ProTox-II) were utilized to predict the ADMET parameters. The <i>in-silico</i> pharmacokinetics predictions reveled that <i>epi</i>-magnolin (<b>3</b>) has significant oral bioavailability and drug-like capabilities.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
