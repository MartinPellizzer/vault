Full-length 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose-5-Phosphate-Synthase (CaDXS) gene was isolated for the study from the previously annotated Centella asiatica leaves transcriptomic data. The CaDXS gene sequence was submitted to the NCBI databases with GenBank accession number MZ997832. The full-length CaDXS gene contained a 2244 base pair open reading frame that encoded a 747 amino acid polypeptide. The predicted molecular weight (MW) and theoretical pI of DXS are 76.28\u00a0kDa and 6.86, respectively. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of amino acids and phylogenetic studies suggest that CaDXS shares high similarities with DXS from other plants DXS belonging to different families. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) version 10.1.6. Structural analysis provided fundamental information about the three-dimensional features and physicochemical parameters of the CaDXS protein. Quantitative expression analysis showed that CaDXS transcripts were maximally expressed in leaf, followed by petiole, roots, and node tissues. CaDXS was cloned into the expression vector pET28a, expressed heterologously in DH5\u03b1 bacteria, confirmed by sequencing, and subsequently characterized by protein expression and functional complementation. The study focused on understanding the protein structure, biological significance, regulatory mechanism, functional analysis, and gene characterization of the centellosides biosynthetic pathway gene DXS for the first time in the plant. It would provide new information about the metabolic pathway and its relative contribution to isoprenoid biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
