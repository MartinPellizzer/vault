The mitotic cycle time thus estimated was found to be 12.6h of which the distribution of component phases was G1 = 1.75 h, S = 6.3 h, G2 = 3.75 h and division phase (M) = 0.8 h. Dry seeds were metabolically activated by soaking in water to show that the first batch amongst the asynchronous population of cells in the seeds enters into S phase after 18 h of such soaking at 16 degrees C. Mitotic synchrony to the tune of 80% could be realised when such presoaked seeds were administered 5 mMole hydroxyurea for 20 h at 16 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Lavania", "ForeName": "U C", "Initials": "UC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "S Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8979483"]}}]}
