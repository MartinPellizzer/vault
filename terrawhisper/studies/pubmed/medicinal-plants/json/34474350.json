SGI has shown strong antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-apoptotic effect need to be addressed.", "H9c2 cell apoptosis model was established by treatment of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Cell survival rates were examined by MTS assay, cell apoptosis rates were determined by flow cytometry, levels of intracellular ROS were assessed by ROS kit, proteome phosphorylation was determined by phosphoproteomic analysis, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated c-Jun, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 were examined by Western blot.", "SGI showed protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced reduced cell viability, elevated ROS, and increased apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Phosphorylation proteomics detected a total of 3369 proteins with 78 protein of upregulated phosphorylation and 104 protein of downregulated phosphorylation. Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes pathway analyses of differentially phosphorylated proteins showed that the ERK pathway, the downstream pathway of the focal adhesion pathway related to apoptosis, was highly enriched, and the phosphorylation levels of ERK and c-Jun were confirmed by Western blot. In addition, the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 significantly inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of SGI.", "SGI antagonizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell apoptosis by activating the ERK pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
