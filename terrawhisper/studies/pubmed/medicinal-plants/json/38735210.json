It is also a seasoning for cooking, with the functions of appetizing, invigorating the spleen, and being digestive-promoting. Amomum tsaoko (AT) has three adulterants, Amomum paratsaoko (AP), Amomum koenigii (AK), and Alpinia katsumadai Hayata, because of the confusion in historical classics regarding recorded sources as well as the near geographic distribution and fruit morphological similarities. In this study, we established a functional dyspepsia (FD) rat model and then treated it with the corresponding medicinal solutions AT, AP, AK, and AKH. The gastric emptying rate, intestinal propulsion rate, serum biochemical indicators, histopathological changes, and fecal metabolism were measured. The efficacy and mechanism of AT, AP, AK, and AKH in the treatment of FD were compared. Fecal metabolomics revealed that 20 potential biomarkers were involved in seven significant metabolic pathways in FD rats. These pathways include ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, purine metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. AP regulates 6 metabolic pathways, 5 metabolic pathways affected by AT, 4 metabolic pathways affected by AK, and 2 metabolic pathways affected by AKH.The above results suggest that the different effects of AT, AP, AK, and AKH on FD rats may be due to their different regulatory effects on the metabolome."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
