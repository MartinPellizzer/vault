Socio-linguistic groups throughout China have traditionally used plants as fermentation starters (or koji) for brewing traditional rice wine. The objective of this study was to evaluate traditional knowledge, diversity, and values regarding plants used as starters for brewing glutinous rice wine in the Dong communities in the Guizhou Province of China, an area of rich biological and cultural diversity.", "Semi-structured interviews were administered for collecting ethnobotanical data on plants used as starters for brewing glutinous rice wine in Dong communities. Field work was carried out in three communities in Guizhou Province from September 2017 to July 2018. A total of 217 informants were interviewed from the villages.", "A total of 60 plant species were identified to be used as starters for brewing glutinous rice wine, belonging to 58 genera in 36 families. Asteraceae and Rosaceae are the most represented botanical families for use as a fermentation starter for rice wine with 6 species respectively, followed by Lamiaceae (4 species); Asparagaceae, Menispermaceae, and Polygonaceae (3 species respectively); and Lardizabalaceae, Leguminosae, Moraceae, Poaceae, and Rubiaceae (2 species, respectively). The other botanical families were represented by one species each. The species used for fermentation starters consist of herbs (60.0%), shrubs (23.3%), climbers (10.0%), and trees (6.7%). The parts used include the root (21.7%), leaf (20.0%), and the whole plant (16.7%). Findings indicate a significant relationship between knowledge of plants used as fermentation starters with age (P value <\u20090.001) and educational status (P value\u2009=\u20090.004) but not with gender (P value\u2009=\u20090.179) and occupation (P value\u2009=\u20090.059). The species that are most used by informants include Pueraria lobata var. montana (Lour.) van der Maesen (UV\u2009=\u20091.74; Leguminosae), Actinidia eriantha Benth. (UV\u2009=\u20091.51; Actinidiaceae), Oryza sativa L. var. glutinosa Matsum (UV\u2009=\u20091.5; Poaceae).", "This study highlights that while most of the Dong informants continue to use a diverse range of plants as a fermentation starter for brewing glutinous rice wine, knowledge of these plants is being lost by the younger generations. Documentation of traditional ethnobotanical knowledge and outreach is thus needed to conserve biocultural diversity in the rural Dong communities in southern China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local United Engineering Laboratory of Integrative Utilization Technology of Eucommia ulmoides, Jishou University, Jishou, 416000, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jianwu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ruifei", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health Science, Kaili University, Kaili, 556011, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Qiyi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local United Engineering Laboratory of Integrative Utilization Technology of Eucommia ulmoides, Jishou University, Jishou, 416000, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Gongxi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local United Engineering Laboratory of Integrative Utilization Technology of Eucommia ulmoides, Jishou University, Jishou, 416000, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kegang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Food and Health Lab, Department of Health and Human Development, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, 59717, USA."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Selena", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6573-6049"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China. long@mail.kib.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100081, China. long@mail.kib.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650201, China. long@mail.kib.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Chunlin", "Initials": "C"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31761143001, 31870316 & 31560088", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "KLEM-ZZ201806", "Agency": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Processes (CN)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "YLDXXK201819", "Agency": "Minzu University of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "B08044", "Agency": "Ministry of Education of China and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018CT5012", "Agency": "Special Funds Project for Central Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017-6", "Agency": "Open Programme of Center of Tujia Medical Research in Hunan Province, China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "JD201605, NLE201708", "Agency": "Research Platform Foundation of Jishou University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnobiol Ethnomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101245794", "ISSNLinking": "1746-4269"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: We followed ethical guidelines adopted by the International Society of Ethnobiology (2008).
