A total of 23 laboratories representing federal agencies and private industry in the United States and Canada participated in this collaborative study. Foods were inoculated with Listeria species including L. monocytogenes, with the exception of 3 lots of green beans that were naturally contaminated. During this study, 1509 samples and controls were analyzed and confirmed, of which 370 were positive and 921 were negative by both methods. One hundred and fifteen samples were positive by culture methods but negative by VIP. One hundred and thirty-two were negative by culture methods but positive by the VIP. Twenty-nine samples were negative by VIP and by culture methods but confirmed positive when VIP selective enrichment broths were subcultured to selective agars. The VIP method for detection of L. monocytogenes and related Listeria spp. in foods has been adopted first action by AOAC INTERNATIONAL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BioControl Systems, Inc., Bothell, WA 98011, USA."}], "LastName": "Feldsine", "ForeName": "P T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lienau", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forgey", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Calhoon", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dairy Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decapoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guidelines as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Precipitin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sample Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Shellfish"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Department of Agriculture"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9241843"]}}]}
