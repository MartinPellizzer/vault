The aim of this study is to explore the potential of liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-TOF-MS) method in the determination of these important alkaloids in plant matrices. The application of this method has been proven through 26 naturally occurring steroidal alkaloids in Fritillaria species. Accurate mass measurements within 4 ppm error were obtained for all the alkaloids detected out of various plant matrices, which allowed an unequivocal identification of the target steroidal alkaloids. The bunching factor for mass spectrometer, an important parameter significantly affecting the precision and accuracy of quantitative method, was firstly optimized in this work and satisfactory precision and linearity were achieved by the optimization of that parameter. The ranges of RSD values of intra-day and inter-day variability for all alkaloids were decreased remarkably from 41.8-159% and 13.2-140% to 0.32-7.98% and 2.37-16.1%, respectively, when the value of bunching factor was optimized from 1 to 3. Linearity of response more than two orders of magnitude was also demonstrated (regression coefficient >0.99). The LC/TOF-MS detection method offered improvements to the sensitivity, compared with previously applied LC (or GC) methods, with limits of detection down to 0.0014-0.0335 microg/ml. The results in this paper illustrate the robustness and applicability of LC/TOF-MS for steroidal alkaloids analysis in plant samples. In addition, relative quantitative determination of steroidal alkaloid with one popular analyte verticinone which is commercially available was also investigated in order to break through the choke point of lack of standards in phytochemical analysis. The accuracies of relative quantitative method for steroidal alkaloids determinations with verticinone were 90.6-110.0% (average 98.5%) suggesting that it is feasible to quantify steroidal alkaloids by the proposed relative quantitative determination method within acceptable errors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 24, Tongjia Lane, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jian-Liang", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Mei-Ting", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fritillaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18061602", "10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.030", "S0021-9673(07)01954-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
