SARSCoV- 2 is zoonotic and highly contagious, causing severe pneumonia-like symptoms. The efficacy of the different potential drug and drug candidates against COVID-19 has been investigated, which are under various stages of clinical trials. The drugs effective against SARS, and Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), have been proposed to have a high potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we selected plant-based materials implicated in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19. The plant produces secondary metabolites in response to viral infection. Different classes of secondary metabolites have different mechanisms to counter virus attacks. Many nanomaterials produced by carbohydrates and lipids have been exploited for their in-vitro and in-vivo delivery of antiviral therapeutics. The vaccine has shown impressive results in producing antibodies against SARS-CoV2 and has been evaluated for safety, tolerance, and preliminary immunogenicity. Similarly, DNA/RNA-based therapy has shown high clinical significance. Various forms of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and phytonutrients help to enhance immunity and be implicated in the control of COVID-19. However, such measures should not replace social distancing, quarantine and special care."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, New Delhi-110019, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Indrakant K", "Initials": "IK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, New Delhi-110019, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Pratibha", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, New Delhi-110019, India."}], "LastName": "Mittal", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Hansraj College, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore- 637551, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Singal", "ForeName": "Bharti", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, P.O.
