Poor seed germination of this plant is a critical problem that affects the final yield and the availability of the products in the market. Continuous cropping without supplying soil nutrients is also a serious issue as it results in declining soil fertility. This review highlights the important use of beneficial bacteria for the enhancement of Stevia rebaudiana growth and its dynamic interactions in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and endosphere. Fertilizers can increase crop yield and preserve and improve soil fertility. There is a rising concern that prolonged usage of chemical fertilizers may have negative impacts on the ecosystem of the soil. On the other hand, soil health and fertility are improved by plant growth-promoting bacteria which could eventually increase plant growth and productivity. Accordingly, a biocompatible strategy involving beneficial microorganisms inoculation is applied to boost plant growth and reduce the negative effects of chemical fertilizers. Plants benefit extensively from endophytic bacteria, which promote growth and induce resistance to pathogens and stresses. Additionally, several plant growth-promoting bacteria are able to produce amino acids, polyamines, and hormones that can be used as alternatives to chemicals. Therefore, understanding the dynamic interactions between bacteria and Stevia can help make the favorable bacterial bio-formulations, use them more effectively, and apply them to Stevia to improve yield and quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
