Evaluating the effect of M.\u00a0communis extract on programmed cell death and increased activity of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in hydatid cyst protoscolices was conducted by treating the protoscolices with different concentration (5, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/mL) of M.\u00a0communis extract at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4\u00a0h by using the Bradford test and ELISA commercial kits.", "The extract of M.\u00a0communis at all concentrations led to initiation of programmed cell death in protoscolices and this effect, was only significant at 50 and 100\u00a0mg/mL concentrations, compared to the negative control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Also, the activity of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in hydatid cyst protoscolices, was shown that the extract at all 3 concentrations could only increase the activity of caspases 3 and 9. Moreover, a significant increase in the activity of caspase 3 was only observed at concentrations 50 and 100\u00a0mg/mL by 37.00% and 66.19% while a significant increase in the activity of caspase 9\u00a0at the same concentrations was observed by 20.89% and 63.67%, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "The extract of M.\u00a0communis at different concentrations could increase the activity of caspases 3 and 9 and caused programmed cell death in hydatid cyst protoscolices however, this effect was significant at high concentrations of the extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
