Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major surface molecule of most gram-negative bacteria and routinely used as a sepsis model in investigation studies. Crocin is an active compound of saffron which has different pharmacological properties such as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory. In this research, the protective effect of crocin was evaluated against LPS-induced toxicity in the embryonic cardiomyocyte cell line (H9c2).", "The cells were pre-treated with different concentration of crocin (10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM) for 24\u202fh, and then LPS was added (10\u202f\u03bcg/ml) for another 24\u202fh. Afterward, the percentage of cell viability and the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, PGE<sub>2</sub>, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), gene expression levels (TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and iNOS), and the level of nitric oxide (NO) and thiol were measured.", "Our results showed that LPS reduced cell viability, increased the levels of cytokines, gene-expression, nitric oxide, and thiol. Crocin attenuated the LPS-induced toxicity in H9c2 cells via reducing the levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, PGE<sub>2</sub>, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), gene expression (TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and iNOS, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and NO (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), whereas increased the level of thiol content (p\u202f<\u202f0.001).", "The observed results revealed that crocin has preventive effects on the LPS induced sepsis and its cardiac toxicity in-vitro model. Probably, these findings are related to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of crocin. However, performing further animal studies are necessary to support the therapeutic effects of crocin in septic shock cardiac dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
