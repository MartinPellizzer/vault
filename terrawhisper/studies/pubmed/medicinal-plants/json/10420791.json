Among health workers, acceptance and use was 100%, while in patients the level of acceptance was of 92% and of use it was 90%. Differences between groups are significant (p < 0.05). The more frequently used plants are Gordolobo (Gnaphalium sp.), Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp., probably E. globulus), spearmint (Mentha sp.), camomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and prickly pear cladodes (the vegetative parts of the prickly pear, Opuntia sp.
