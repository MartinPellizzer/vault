The present review aims to provide up-to-date information on E. helioscopia, including its traditional uses, phytochemistry, quality control, pharmacological research, toxicology, and human studies in exploring future scientific and therapeutic potentials in disease treatment. So far, a total of 173 terpenoids, as well as polyphenols, steroids, lipids, and volatile oils have been isolated and identified from E. helioscopia. Among them, diterpenoids and \ufb02avonoids are the most important and abundant bioactive constituents. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that E. helioscopia has outstanding bioactivities especially on antiproliferative and multidrug resistance modulating. Nevertheless, most of these studies were carried out in vitro. The quality control, metabolites identification, in-depth in-vivo studies as well as toxicology and human studies for the crude extracts and active components are still very limited. Consequently, more well-designed pre-clinical and clinical studies are required to justify their reported therapeutic potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
