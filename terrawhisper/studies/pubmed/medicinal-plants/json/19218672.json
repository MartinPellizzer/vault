The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of asthma, allergy, and respiratory symptoms in centenarians included in the Polish Centenarians Program, POLSTU 2001, conducted between 2001 and 2004. The study group consisted of 301 subjects including 258 females and 43 males. Research data were gathered in a questionnaire designed exclusively for the study, completed by the interviewer during meetings with the subjects and their families. According to the medical history reported by the subjects, 10 persons (3.3%) suffered from asthma and 41 (13.6%) from allergy. There were no subjects with childhood onset asthma. Allergy to food and medicinal products was the most prevalent. One in four centenarians reported dyspnea and one in eight complained of cough. When analyzed in relation to gender, cough was more prevalent in males, which might have been related to cigarette smoking. Respiratory disorders are frequent in elderly populations, but symptoms may be underreported, especially in the situation of coexisting medical problems. Moreover, it might be difficult to perform full diagnostic procedures in the very elderly due to disability, cognitive impairment, and technical problems. Thus, medical care for the aged should be based on thorough medical evaluation supported by the medical history and reliable information on physician-diagnosed diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mossakowska", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pawlinska-Chmara", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Broczek", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9114501", "ISSNLinking": "0867-5910"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19218672"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
