Compounds 1 and 2, which share a 1,2-seco-spirocyclic PPAP skeleton, could be derived from spirocyclic PPAP, with a common octahydrospiro[cyclohexan-1,5'-indene]-2,4,6-trione core, through a cascade of Retro-Claisen, keto-enol tautomerism, and esterification reactions. Aldolization of normal spirocyclic PPAP yielded 3, which has a caged framework with a 6/5/6/5/6 ring system. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The inhibitory activities of all isolates were tested in three human cancer cell lines and a zebrafish model. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed moderate cytotoxicity against HCT116\u00a0cells (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.87 and 9.86\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). The mechanisms of these compounds were evaluated using Western blot assays. Compounds 3 and 5 inhibited the growth of sub-intestinal vessels in zebrafish embryos. Further, the target genes were screened using real-time PCR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
