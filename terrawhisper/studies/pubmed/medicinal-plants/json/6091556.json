The reaction mechanism was investigated by means of initial velocity studies. Both substrates inhibited the enzyme; the inhibition caused by MgATP was linear-uncompetitive with respect to fructose whereas that caused by D-fructose was hyperbolic-noncompetitive against MgATP. The product D-fructose 6-phosphate caused hyperbolic-noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both substrates. MgADP caused noncompetitive inhibition, which gave intercept and slope replots that were linear with D-fructose but hyperbolic with MgATP. Free Mg2+ caused linear-uncompetitive inhibition when either substrate was varied. L-Sorbose and beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate were used as analogs of D-fructose and MgATP, respectively. Inhibition experiments using these compounds indicated that substrate addition was steady-state ordered, with MgATP adding first. The product inhibition experiments were found to be consistent with a steady-state random release of products. The substrate inhibition caused by MgATP was most likely due to the formation of an enzyme-MgATP-product dead-end complex, whereas that caused by D-fructose was due to alternative pathways in the reaction mechanism. The inhibition caused by Mg2+ can be explained in terms of a dead-end complex with either a central complex or an enzyme-product complex."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stone", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructosephosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30237-26-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3469-78-1", "NameOfSubstance": "5'-adenylyl (beta,gamma-methylene)diphosphonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6814-87-5", "NameOfSubstance": "fructose-6-phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructokinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NV2001607Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Sorbose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NYX13NT29D", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructokinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fructosephosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6091556", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90503-4", "0003-9861(84)90503-4"]}}]}
