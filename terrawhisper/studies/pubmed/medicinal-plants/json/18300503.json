Mice\u015b writhing response were induce by ip 0.9% acetic acid and foot ache were induced by sc formaldehyde. Mices feet or ears were smeated by sccarrageenin or dimethylbenzene. And the effects of these samples were evaluated on these models.", "The sample II 40 g/kg significantly decreased the writhing response induced by acetic acid and relieved mice foot pain induced by formaldehyde, inhibited the swelling of mice ear induced by dimethylbenzene. It markedly decreased the body weight and increased the index of testes in mice. The sample III 20 g/kg inhibited foot swelling induced by carrageenin and ear swelling induced by dimethylbenzene in mice. The sample I significantly relieved the foot pain induced by formaldehyde, increased the indexes of testis and adrenal gland in mice. The sample IV had no action on pain or inflammatory in mice. The LD50 of the sample II was 82.85 g/kg. And ig the sample I 133.2 g/kg, sample III 122.0 g/kg or sample IV 52.0 g/kg could not induce mice to death.", "The sample II has anti-inflammatory and antalgic action. But it also has serious acute toxicity. These results show that the efficacious component of Fructus Meilae Toosendan may exist in the ethyl acetate extraction, The toxicity and efficacious component may be the same material."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Sichuan Chengdu 610041, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yuan-yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Da-xuan", "Initials": "DX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Zheng-huai", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76845O8NMZ", "NameOfSubstance": "ethyl acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Melia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18300503"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
