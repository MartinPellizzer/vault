Surveys for damping-off of <i>A. carmichaelii</i> were conducted from 2016 to 2018 in three of China's major planting areas (Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan Province). Damping-off was observed from April to June with disease incidences ranging from 5% to 11% in ten investigated fields. In the early stage of disease development, the roots were fully covered by white mycelia. When the disease was severe, seedlings were stunted, turned yellow, had withered roots, and some eventually died. One fungus was consistently isolated from the diseased roots in the planting areas of Shaanxi Province (33\u00b07'42\u2033N and 107\u00b020'27\u2033E) on PDA medium. It was identified as <i>Mucor circinelloides</i>, based on morphological characteristics (Schipper 1976). Three isolates from different regions were characterized by yellowish colonies composed of tall and short sporangiophores 6-11 \u00b5m in width, terminal and globose sporangia, ellipsoidal sporangiospores 5-8 \u00b5m in length and 4-5 \u00b5m in width, and obovoid columellae. The internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and the large subunit (28S) of ribosomal RNA gene from the representative isolate, MC180610 (GenBank accession no. MK087755, MT043749), were also amplified and sequenced using the universal primer sets, ITS1/ITS4 and NL1/NL4, respectively. BLAST analyses of the ITS sequence showed 99.38% identity with the type strain (CBS 195.68) of M. circinelloides (GenBank accession no. NR_126116), and the 28S sequence showed 99.44% identity with the strain (CBS 274.49) of <i>M. circinelloides f. circinelloides</i> (GenBank accession no. MH868051). The pathogenicity of <i>M. circinelloides</i> isolate (MC180610) to <i>A. carmichaelii</i> was examined by inoculating 150 ml of the hypha suspension of <i>M. circinelloides</i> prepared from a 10-day-old potato dextrose broth culture into the soils of healthy potted <i>A. carmichaelii</i> plants. Uninoculated potted <i>A. carmichaelii</i> plants served as controls. There were three replicates for the inoculated and control plants. All the potted <i>A. carmichaelii</i> plants were incubated at 25\u00b0C under 12 h light 12 h dark conditions. The symptoms that developed on <i>M. circinelloides</i> inoculated <i>A. carmichaelii</i> plants were similar to those observed in the field; control plants did not show symptoms. The pathogen was reisolated from symptomatic roots onto the PDA medium and morphologically identified as <i>M. circinelloides</i>. <i>M. circinelloides</i> has been reported as a pathogen of papaya (<i>Carica papaya</i>), Mandarin fruits (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>), and sweet potatoes (<i>Ipomea batatas</i>), respectively (Cruz-Lachica et al. 2018; Saito et al. 2016; Oladoye et al. 2016), but it has never been reported on <i>A. carmichaelii</i> before. This is the first report of damping-off caused by <i>M. circinelloides</i> on <i>A. carmichaelii</i>. This pathogen may present a threat to the production of <i>A. carmichaelii</i> in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry , Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; ljcui@snnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Langjun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; 751420038@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiayang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; zhang1xin@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China; yaping.yan@snnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, 12401, College of Life Sciences, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, 710119; limz@snnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mingzhu", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32896215", "10.1094/PDIS-02-20-0359-PDN"]}}]}
