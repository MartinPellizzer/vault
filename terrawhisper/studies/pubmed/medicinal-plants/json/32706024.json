It has been recognized that production of the authentic and high-quality herbal drugs became the prerequisite for maintaining the healthy development of the traditional medicine industry. To this end, intensive research efforts have been devoted to the basic studies, in order to pave a way for standardized authentication of the plant materials, and bioengineering of the metabolic pathways in the medicinal plants. In this paper, the recent advances of omics studies on the medicinal plants were summarized from several aspects, including phenomics and taxonomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We proposed a multi-omics data-based workflow for medicinal plant research. It was emphasized that integration of the omics data was important for plant authentication and mechanistic studies on plant metabolism. Additionally, the computational tools for proper storage, efficient processing and high-throughput analyses of the omics data have been introduced into the workflow. According to the workflow, authentication of the medicinal plant materials should not only be performed at the phenomics level but also be implemented by genomic and metabolomic marker-based examination. On the other hand, functional genomics studies, transcriptional regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions will contribute greatly for deciphering the secondary metabolic pathways. Finally, we hope that our work could inspire further efforts on the bioinformatics-assisted, integrated omics studies on the medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
