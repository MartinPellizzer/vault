Through field investigation and literature collation, this paper sorted out 24 sets of simulated cultivation modes of B.striata, including 4 kinds of sub-forest imitative wild planting techniques, 10 kinds of B.striata-economic forest cooperative development mode, 14 kinds of intercropping techniques of B.striata and 1 kind of ecological rotation technique of B.striata-edible fungi under economic forest. Combining economic benefit, social benefit and ecological benefit, the advantages and disadvantages of these planting patterns were compared. The ecological principles of B.striata simulative cultivation are analyzed in detail, as follows:(1) the wild cultivation of B.striata simulative cultivation under forest is to utilize the complementary principle of land resources under forest and spatial light and heat resources, and carry out the compound cultivation of cultivating forest with medicine and growing with short growth;(2) the intercropping of B.striata makes full use of the difference in height and height of the two plants to meet their needs for light, humidity and ventilation, reduce the cost of shading and weeding, improve the risk-resistant ability of Chinese medicinal materials cultivation, and increase the utilization rate of land, and give consideration to the benefits of both length and length;(3) the ecological rotation technology of &quot;B.striata-edible fungi&quot; in economic forests is to realize the effective utilization of waste bacteria and residues according to the mutually beneficial relationship between B.striata and edible fungi. The promotion and optimization of B.striata imitated wild cultivation technology will further promote the sustainable development of B.striata industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Jin-Qiang", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng-Hong", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wei-Ke", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lan-Ping", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orchidaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350281", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200707.102"]}}]}
