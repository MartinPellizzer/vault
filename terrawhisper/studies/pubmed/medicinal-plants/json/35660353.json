(DBL) is an herbal medicine used for the treatment of thyroid diseases and tumors in China. However, the hepatotoxicity of DBL limits its wide safe use. Diosbulbin B (DSB) is the most abundant diterpene lactone occurring in DBL. Numbers of studies showed that this furanoterpenoid plays an important role in DBL-induced liver injury and that DSB is metabolized to a cis-enedial intermediate which reacts with protein to form protein covalent binding and induces hepatotoxicity.", "The present study aimed to define the association of DSB content in DBL with the severity of DBL hepatotoxicity to ensure the safe use of the herbal medicine in clinical practice and to determine the role of DSB in DBL-induced liver injury.", "Chemical chromatographic fingerprints of DBL were established by UPLC-MS/MS. Their hepatotoxicity potencies were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Metabolic activation of DSB was evaluated by liver microsomal incubation. Protein modification was assessed by mass spectrometry and immunostaining.", "The contents of DSB in DBL herbs collected from 11 locations in China varied dramatically with as much as 47-fold difference. The hepatotoxicity potencies of DBL herbs were found to be proportional to the contents of DSB. Intensified protein adduction derived from the reactive metabolite of DSB was observed in mice administered DBL with high contents of DSB.", "The findings not only demonstrated that contents of DSB can be quite different depending on harvest location and special attention needs to pay for quality control of DBL but also suggest DSB is a key contributor for DBL-induced hepatotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
