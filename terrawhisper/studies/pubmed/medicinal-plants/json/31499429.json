Quality control is needed to guarantee the safety and quality of these consumables. In this regard, fingerprinting techniques are important for inspection of the authenticity and for quality control. Analytical fingerprinting techniques provide signals related to the composition of a matrix (oil, plant extract, food\u2026). The resulting fingerprint (spectrum or chromatogram) obtained for an untargeted or targeted approach is coupled to chemometric data processing, which may allow, for instance, the desired identification or discrimination of the sample considered. In this context, recent advances in untargeted/targeted fingerprinting approaches (especially chromatographic and spectroscopic) were described and their application in the taxonomic identification, classification and authentication of plants (medicinal) and essential oils discussed. An overview of the applications of untargeted/targeted fingerprinting techniques on herbal-extracts and essential-oils analysis, using different chemometric tools, has been included."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
