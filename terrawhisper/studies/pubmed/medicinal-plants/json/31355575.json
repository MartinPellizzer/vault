The separation was performed on Agilent Eclipse Plus C_(18) column( 2. 1 mm\u00d7100 mm,1. 8 \u03bcm),with 0. 1% formic acid solution( A)-acetonitrile( B) as the mobile phase for gradient elution. Mass spectrometry data of biological samples were obtained under positive and negative electrospray ion mode. By comparing chromatogram differences between blank samples and drug treatment samples,prototype components and metabolites of the effective components of P. orientale extract were identified. The results showed that 12 metabolites were detected in serum and 26 metabolites in urine( including cross-components) of rats. The main metabolic pathways included hydrogenation,hydroxylation,glucuronidation,sulfation reaction,and methylation-glucuronidation,etc. The method established in this study was reliable and effective for studying the metabolic characteristics of the effective components of P. orientale in rats,and it can provide a reference for further studies on therapeutic material basis of this herb."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Si-Ying", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine ( Ministry of Education) ,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31355575", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190114.002"]}}]}
