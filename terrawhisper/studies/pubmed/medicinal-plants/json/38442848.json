Up to now, over 129 sesquiterpenoids have been isolated and identified from this plant genus, including 114 germacrane-type, 7 guaianolide-type, 5 eudesmane-type, 1 elemanolide-type, and 2 bis-sesquiterpenoids. These sesquiterpenoids were reported to show a diverse range of pharmacological properties, including cytotoxic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiprotozoal. Consequently, some of them were identified as active scaffolds in the design and development of drugs. Considering that there is currently no overview available that covers the sesquiterpenoids and their biological activities in the Elephantopus genus, this article aims to comprehensively review the chemical structures, biosynthetic pathways, pharmacological properties, and structure-activity relationship of sesquiterpenoids found in the Elephantopus genus, which will establish a theoretical framework that can guide further research and exploration of sesquiterpenoids from Elephantopus plants as promising therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
