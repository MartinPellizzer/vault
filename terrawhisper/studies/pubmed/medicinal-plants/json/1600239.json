The PvPR3 transcript accumulates gradually over 24 hr in elicitor-treated cell suspensions. This pattern of expression is distinct from those of previously reported elicitor-induced transcripts in bean. Specifically, transcripts encoding two recently described acidic bean PR proteins, phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, accumulate to maximal levels by 4-8 hr, while hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein mRNA accumulation is delayed by several hours. The PvPR3 mRNA also accumulates after wounding of hypocotyls with kinetics comparable to those of mRNA encoding phenylpropanoid pathway mRNAs. PvPR3 appears to exist as a single gene within a family of approximately 15 related genes in the bean genome. The PvPR3 protein deduced from the cDNA sequences (14,950 Da pI = 10.0) lacks a putative signal peptide suggesting a cytosolic localization. Amino acid sequence comparisons with databases revealed that PvPR3 represents a new class of PR proteins without significant sequence homology to previously characterized PR proteins or other proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Texas, Austin 78713."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Y K", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hinojos", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mehdy", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pathogenesis-related proteins, plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1600239", "10.1094/mpmi-5-089"]}}]}
