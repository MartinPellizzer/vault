All fractions tested were not mutagenic toward either strain TA98 or TA100 whether tested in the presence or absence of S-9 mix. Interestingly, however, various fractions--especially those extracted by organic solvents such as petroleum ether, hexane, and chloroform, as well as some purified compounds from these plants--could strongly inhibit the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an indirect mutagen, when tested in the presence of S-9 mix but not that of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), which does not require metabolic activation for its mutagenicity. Furthermore, these fractions could markedly inhibit the activity of rat liver aniline hydroxylase, which is one of the cytochrome-P450-mediated reactions. These results therefore suggest that these Thai medicinal plants contain an antimutagen(s) which inhibits chemical mutagenesis by inhibiting the enzyme activities necessary for activation of indirect mutagens/carcinogens. Identification as well as anticarcinogenicity of purified compounds of these plants are being investigated in our laboratory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Chemical Carcinogenesis Section, National Cancer Institute, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Rojanapo", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tepsuwan", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Siripong", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Basic Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0360077", "ISSNLinking": "0090-5542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Hydroxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2183782", "10.1007/978-1-4615-9561-8_47"]}}]}
