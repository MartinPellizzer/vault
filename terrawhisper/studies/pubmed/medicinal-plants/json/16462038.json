The identification of the botanical origins of these crude drugs is generally difficult from their morphological and chemical features only. In this study, for identification with more reliable, nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of five species of medicinal Atractylodes were sequenced. As a result, specific ITS genotypes were recognized by each species. The four species (A. japonica, A. macrocephala, A. lancea, and A. chinensis) prescribed in Chinese and Japanese Pharmacopoeias as botanical origins of crude Atractylodes drugs could be distinguished by their ITS sequences because they had difference genotypes on the ITS sequences. However, the genotype of A. koreana was the same as that of A. chinensis. Additionally, hybrids between A. lancea and A. chinensis were also recognized as nucleotide additives on their ITS sequences. In this study, several morphological characteristics were researched by their genotype, too. As this result, the hybrids recognized from the genetic analysis had intermediate morphological characteristics between A. lancea and A. chinensis. It was also recognized that A. lancea and A. chinensis except for their hybrids were significant differences. It is therefore suggested that ITS sequences of nrDNA would be useful for the identification of the crude drugs derived from Atractylodes species and their interspecific hybridizations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Resources Research Department, Central Research Laboratories, Tsumura & Co., Ibaraki 300-1192, Japan. shiba_mao@mail.tsumura.co.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shiba", "ForeName": "Mao", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miki", "ForeName": "Eiji", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaji", "ForeName": "Hiroki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morota", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terabayashi", "ForeName": "Susumu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "Shuichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyamoto", "ForeName": "Ken-ichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aburada", "ForeName": "Masaki", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Atractylodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16462038", "10.1248/bpb.29.315", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/29.315"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
