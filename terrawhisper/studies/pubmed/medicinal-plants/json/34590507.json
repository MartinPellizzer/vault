Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), have been majorly resulted due to degeneration of neurons and neuroinflammation progressively. There are many similarities that correlates both AD and PD on a cellular and sub-cellular level. Therefore, a hope for therapeutic advancement for simultaneous upgradation in both the diseases are directly depending on the discovery of common mechanism at molecular and cellular level. Recent and past evidences from scientific literature supporting the efficacy of plants flavonoids in treatment and protection of both AD and PD. Further, dietary flavones, specially Heptamethoxyflavone, Kaempferitrin, Vitexin and Amentoflavone gains recently much more attention for producing many health beneficiary effects including neuroprotection. Despite of these evidence a detailed updated overview of neuroprotective effects against both AD and PD by Heptamethoxyflavone, Kaempferitrin, Vitexin and Amentoflavone are still missing. In this context several published studies were assessed by using various online electronic search engines/databases to meet the objective from 1981 to 2021 (Approx. 224). Therefore, present review was designed to deliver the detailed description on these flavones including therapeutic benefits in AD, PD and other CNS complications with critical analysis on underlying mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, DIT University, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Varshney", "ForeName": "Mansi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7429-8047"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, DIT University, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Bhavna", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, DIT University, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Rana", "ForeName": "Vijay Singh", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0192-1384"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, DIT University, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Sethiya", "ForeName": "Neeraj K", "Initials": "NK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9VP70K75OK", "NameOfSubstance": "vitexin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VPV01U3R59", "NameOfSubstance": "lespenefril"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9I1VC79L77", "NameOfSubstance": "amentoflavone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Parkinson Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34590507", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1980761"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
