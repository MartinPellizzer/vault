An acidic homogenous polysaccharide, namely SIP-II was isolated from Saussurea involucrate through anion exchange and gel permeation column chromatography. The structure of the SIP-II was elucidated through the combination of HPLC, GC-MS, IC, peroxide oxidation, smith degradation, methylation, NMR analysis, it was mainly composed of arabinose, rhamnose, galactose, galacturonic acid, and glucose with the molar ratio of 19.85:20.30: 27.12:11.95:8.69 with a molecular weight of 237,570\u00a0Da. The glycosidic linkages of SIP-II mainly composed of \u21921)-\u03b1-L-Rhap-(2\u2192, T-Araf, \u21921)-\u03b2-D-GalpA-(4\u2192, \u21921)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(3,6\u2192, \u21921)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(6\u2192, \u21921)-\u03b1-L-Rhap-(2,4\u2192, T-Galp, and \u21921)-\u03b1-L-Araf-(5\u2192. Meanwhile, the structures were characterized through extensive analysis of UV, FT-IR, SEM-EDX, CD, XRD, and TG. SIP-II possessed a remarkable anti-inflammatory activity by effectively inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, and the anti-inflammatory response of SIP-II might be attributed to the regulation of the NF-\u03baB, MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways. The results showed that polysaccharides from Saussurea involucrate could be a potential ingredient in the functional food and pharmaceutical industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
