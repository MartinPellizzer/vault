Lentils inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum strain 128C54 or 128C84, and noninoculated lentils grown in plant nutrient solution supplemented with 5 mM KNO3, had metribuzin applied to the plants at either 8 or 13 days after planting. When sprayed at 8 days, metribuzin had a significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) negative effect on plant weight, number of nodules, taproot growth, and acetylene reduction activity. Five to 10 days after spraying, the plants began to recover from the inhibitory effects. When spraying was delayed to 13 days after planting, metribuzin had little effect on plant growth. The R. leguminosarum strain used as inoculant affected the degree of inhibition of lentil growth and the rate of plant recovery. Less than 0.2% of foliarly applied metribuzin was translocated to the root. Thus the detrimental effects of metribuzin application to lentils were mainly due to direct effects on the plant, which resulted in indirect effects on nodulation and nitrogen fixation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Microbiology and Food Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada."}], "LastName": "Sprout", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Germida", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QO836138OV", "NameOfSubstance": "metribuzin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triazines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1611561", "10.1139/m92-058"]}}]}
