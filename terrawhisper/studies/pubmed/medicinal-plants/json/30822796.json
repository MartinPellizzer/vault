The mechanism of toxicity includes generation of free radicals, depletion of thiol groups and production of toxic metabolites. Antioxidant compounds may reduce HCBD-nephrotoxicity. In this research we investigated the effect of Rheum turkeatanicum extract against HCBD-toxicity. The animals were divided to 4 groups which were including control (saline, 1\u2009mL/kg), HCBD (100\u2009mg/kg) and treatment groups which received extract at doses 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg. The extract were administered as intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1\u2009h before HCBD injection (i.p.). The animals were anesthetized by ether, 24\u2009h after HCBD administration. The results showed elevation of serum creatinine, serum urea, urinary protein, urinary glucose, malondialdehyde levels in kidney and reduction of thiol in kidney by HCBD. The histopathological studies showed that there was apoptosis and necrosis in HCBD treated groups. Administration of R.turkestanicum reduced HCBD toxicity. The extract reduced hitopathological changes in kidney. It may be concluded that the nephroprotective effect of extract may be due to different mechanisms such as antioxidant activity or by decreasing the toxic metabolites of HCBD or inhibition of enzymes which are involved in the bioactivation of HCBD such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or cysteine-S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanoudi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroumand", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aghaee", "ForeName": "Azita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CQ8AAO9MO1", "NameOfSubstance": "hexachlorobutadiene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosuria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Proteinuria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30822796", "10.1055/a-0821-5653"]}}]}
