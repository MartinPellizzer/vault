L.H. Bailey is a valuable horticultural and medicinal plant that grows under a range of light intensities, from high to low, in the understories of shrubs. To understand how this species adapts to these various environments, we selected two groups of lilyturf growing under poplar trees at two different spacings. Each group was divided into three types, open field, forest edge and shaded forest with high, medium and low irradiance levels, respectively, and then we examined their photosynthetic characteristics, physiology and biomasses.", "Light saturation point, light compensation point and in situ net photosynthetic rate (P<sub>N</sub>) were highest in lilyturf growing under high light. In contrast, lilyturf growing under low light had a higher apparent quantum yield and Chl a and b contents, indicating that they adapted to low light. Although the leaves of lilyturf growing under low light were small, their root tubers were heavier.", "The research demonstrates the eco-physiological basis of lilyturf's shade adaptation mechanism as indicated by photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll fluorescence, Chl a, Chl b and Car contents when grown under different irradiances. We believe that lilyturf is a shade-tolerant plant suitable for planting in undergrowth, but attention should be paid to the canopy density of the forest when interplanting. The findings presented here advance our understanding of the photosynthetic characteristics of understory plants and may assist in the optimization of irradiances in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8716-2197"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and the Environment, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and the Environment, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and the Environment, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and the Environment, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China. zhiwu@njfu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China. zhiwu@njfu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMC Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088674", "ISSNLinking": "1472-6785"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asparagaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liriope Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Busse MD, Cochran P, Barrett J.
