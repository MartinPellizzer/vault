(MEBA) against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon toxicity was investigated. Acacia catechu is considered one of the most potent medicines for various diseases in Ayurveda, a traditional system of Indian medicine. It is a widely used herb that contains a variety of bioactive components such as phenolic acids, alkaloids, and flavonoids among others. In the present study, MEBA was used as a pretreatment orally at two doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight [b.w.] once daily for 7 days), and DMH was administered (at a dose of 40 mg/kg b.w.) subcutaneously on day 7 in Wistar rats. The protective potential of MEBA was assessed in terms of the activity of antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and expression of inflammatory markers (iNOS, COX-2, NF-\u03baB, IL-6). Pretreatment with MEBA significantly abrogated oxidative damage by diminishing tissue lipid peroxidation, increasing enzymatic activities of various antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, reduced glutathione), and diminishing the induced expression of inflammatory markers in the colon tissue of Wistar rats. Furthermore, histopathological findings revealed that pretreatment with (MEBA) reduced intense filtration of inflammatory cells and significantly restored the architecture of colonic tissue. The results of this study indicate that MEBA significantly suppresses DMH-induced toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation and by restoring the architecture of colon tissue."]},
