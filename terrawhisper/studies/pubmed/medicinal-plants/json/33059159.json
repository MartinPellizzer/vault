To investigate the effective factors on ABZSO microextraction by the method, central composite design (CCD) was utilized, and the optimum conditions for ABZSO microextraction were sample pH of 8.0, MIP-mass of 15\u202fmg, sonication time of 12\u202fmin, and eluent (methanol) volume of 0.25\u202fmL. Under the obtained optimal extraction conditions, the value for the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) was respectively showed to be 0.074 and 0.246\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, the calculated peak areas exhibited a linear relationship with the ABZSO concentration ranging from 0.4 to 4200\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>. The analyses of the samples including human plasma and urine, and water were successfully performed by the usage of the D-\u00b5-SPE method, which was a simple and sensitive technique and a suitable alternative for the analysis of ABZSO. In the analysis of ABZSO in various samples, the recoveries at various levels of ABZSO concentrations (50, 300, and 500\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>) were in the range of 95.7-103.0 %, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs; n\u202f=\u202f3) varied from 2.2 to 4.4%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
