Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of kiwifruit on the adipose tissue cell size and activity as well as the gene expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in high-fat diet (HFD) fed hamsters.", "Forty-two male Syrian hamsters were divided into six groups. Control normal (CN) hamsters received normal diet, control HFD (CHF) were fed with a HFD plus a normal diet (15% butter fat + 0.05% cholesterol + a normal diet). Two groups were fed with normal diet including kiwifruit (1.86; Nd.1 or 3.73 g/kg; Nd.2) and two groups were fed with HFD including kiwifruit (1.86;HFd.1or 3.73 g/kg; HFd.2), for 8 weeks.", "Histological examination of adipose tissue showed that the cell size was significantly reduced in the kiwifruit-treated groups (low and high dose) in comparison to their control groups (p<0.05). Kiwifruit supplementation (low and high dose) in normal and HFD groups significantly increased gene expression of CETP in adipose tissue. Kiwifruit had no significant effect on serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride. Although, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increased in HFD-fed hamsters supplemented with 3.73 g/kg of kiwifruit (p<0.05).", "Kiwifruit consumption reduces the size of adipocytes and increases the expression of CETP gene in adipose tissue cells. Despite the increases in CETP expression in adipose tissue, its activity in serum was not changed following kiwifruit supplementation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zaherijamil", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaei", "ForeName": "Narjes", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathobiology, Veterinary Medicine Faculty, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemnia", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradkhani", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saidijam", "ForeName": "Massoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodadadi", "ForeName": "Iraj", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi Oshaghi", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tavilani", "ForeName": "Heidar", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in this research."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abbasi Oshaghi E, Khodadadi I, Saidijam M, Yadegarazari R, Shabab N, Tavilani H, Goodarzi MT.
