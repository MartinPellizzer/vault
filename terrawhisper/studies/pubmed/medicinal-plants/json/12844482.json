Many components derived from dietary or medicinal plants have been found to possess substantial chemopreventive properties. Curcumin, a yellow coloring ingredient of turmeric (Curcuma longa L., Zingiberaceae), has been shown to inhibit experimental carcinogenesis and mutagenesis, but molecular mechanisms underlying its chemopreventive activities remain unclear. In the present work, we assessed the effects of curcumin on 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in female ICR mouse skin. Topical application of the dorsal skin of female ICR mice with 10 nmol TPA led to maximal induction of cox-2 mRNA and protein expression at approximately 1 and 4 h, respectively. When applied topically onto shaven backs of mice 30 min prior to TPA, curcumin inhibited the expression of COX-2 protein in a dose-related manner. Immunohistochemical analysis of TPA-treated mouse skin revealed enhanced expression of COX-2 localized primarily in epidermal layer, which was markedly suppressed by curcumin pre-treatment. Curcumin treatment attenuated TPA- stimulated NF-kappaB activation in mouse skin, which was associated with its blockade of degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaBalpha and also of subsequent translocation of the p65 subunit to nucleus. TPA treatment resulted in rapid activation via phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which are upstream of NF-kappaB. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 strongly inhibited NF-kappaB activation, while p38 inhibitor SB203580 failed to block TPA-induced NF-kappaB activation in mouse skin. Furthermore, U0126 blocked the IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by TPA, thereby blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Curcumin inhibited the catalytic activity of ERK1/2 in mouse skin. Taken together, suppression of COX-2 expression by inhibiting ERK activity and NF-kappaB activation may represent molecular mechanisms underlying previously reported antitumor promoting effects of this phytochemical in mouse skin tumorigenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-741, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chun", "ForeName": "Kyung-Soo", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keum", "ForeName": "Young-Sam", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Seong Su", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yong-Sang", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Su-Hyeong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Surh", "ForeName": "Young-Joon", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nfkbia protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "139874-52-5", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12844482", "10.1093/carcin/bgg107", "bgg107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
