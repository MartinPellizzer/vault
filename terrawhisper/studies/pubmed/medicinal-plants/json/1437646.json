In Experiment 1, milled regular garlic powder was added to the basal AIN-76A diet at 20 g/kg. The results from different schedules of supplementation suggested that a continuous treatment, which started before DMBA and persisted for the entire duration of the study, was most effective in tumor suppression. In Experiment 2, selected allyl group-containing sulfides that are normal constituents of garlic extract were given by gavage in three single doses immediately before DMBA. Several structurally related compounds were found to be protective during the initiation phase in the mammary cancer model. Although the present study was not designed specifically to elucidate the structure-activity relationship with respect to sulfur chain length or alkyl versus alkenyl substitution, our data showed that diallyl disulfide was more active than diallyl sulfide or allyl methyl sulfide. In Experiment 3, the anticarcinogenic activity of selenium-enriched garlic (containing 150 ppm Se dry weight from growth in a selenium-fertilized medium) was compared with that of regular garlic as well as selenite. Animals given the selenium-enriched garlic (final concentration 3 ppm Se in the diet) developed the fewest mammary tumors. Tissue selenium levels, however, were lower in these animals than in those fed the same amount of selenium from selenite. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving cancer prevention with the use of a selenium-rich food system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263."}], "LastName": "Ip", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisk", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stoewsand", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-27706", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1437646", "10.1080/01635589209514197"]}}]}
