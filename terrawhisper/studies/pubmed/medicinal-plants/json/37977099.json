Providing evidence-based advice on herbal medicines could be an effective intervention to improve control of diabetes, if it is designed to address key needs and concerns of T2DM patients.", "To understand the views and experiences of patients and health professionals on herbal treatments for self-management of T2DM.", "MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SOCIOFILE and Google Scholar were searched for qualitative studies in T2DM patients about their views on herbal medicines. Included papers were analysed using thematic synthesis.", "Thirty-one papers (about 30 studies) were included: 20 from low-and-middle income countries, 10 from high income countries, and 1 internet-based study. Almost all studies from high income countries focussed on ethnic minorities. Many people with T2DM wanted a \"cure\", and often took advice from friends and family, but also traditional healers and mass media. However, they were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines with health professionals, whom they perceived as \"closed-minded\". They based their treatment decisions on personal experience (from \"trial-and-error\"), availability, cost and convenience of both herbal and conventional medicines. Most health professionals were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines, or recommended against their use, because of lack of knowledge and concerns about their quality, efficacy and potential interactions.", "Evidence-based information could help to overcome the current lack of communication about herbal medicines between people with T2DM and health professionals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
