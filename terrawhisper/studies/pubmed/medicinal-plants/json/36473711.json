No effective vaccines or drugs are developed till date to control this infection. The NiV-Glycoprotein (NiV-G) is one of the essential proteins for viral entry by binding to the Ephrin-B receptors. The present study screens the potential phytocompounds that can target NiV-G and thereby inhibit the viral entry to human. Computer-aided virtual screening of 1426 phytocompounds from various medicinal plants was carried out to investigate their efficacy as potential therapeutics. Ribavirin, the currently used drug, was also docked to compare the docking score and intermolecular interactions between ligand and target protein. Further, molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations were performed to understand the stability of the docked complexes. Radius of gyrations and Solvent Accessible Surface Area were also performed to evaluate the compactness and solvent behaviour of ligand-receptor complexes during the 100\u2009ns simulation. Our analysis revealed that the alkaloid, Serpentinine, has the highest potency to block NiV-G with favourable binding.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
