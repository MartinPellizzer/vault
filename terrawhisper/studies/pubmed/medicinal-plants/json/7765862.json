Although there are certain antibacterial and antifungal agents available, they usually are very caustic, potentially ototoxic and cannot be used if the ear drum is perforated. Garlic is utilized as a folk medicine in many countries for its antimicrobial and other beneficial properties. In response to a lack of otic preparations, the authors studied the efficacy of garlic extracts against the fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus which are the most common cause of this infection. Aqueous garlic extract (AGE) and concentrated garlic oil (CGO) along with various commercial garlic supplements and pharmaceutical prescriptions were used in an in-vitro study. AGE and especially CGO were found to have antifungal activity. These agents showed similar or better inhibitory effects than the pharmaceutical preparations and demonstrated similar minimum inhibitory concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of New Mexico, School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131."}], "LastName": "Pai", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Platt", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G07GZ97H65", "NameOfSubstance": "Clotrimazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R9400W927I", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketoconazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus fumigatus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus nidulans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus niger"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Clotrimazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ketoconazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mycoses"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Otitis Externa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7765862", "10.1111/j.1472-765x.1995.tb00397.x"]}}]}
