A suspension of the powdered leaf was given by gavage to groups of ten mice. A record was kept of the number of wet faeces passed in 24 hours. There was a linear relationship between the log dose of leaf and the number of wet faeces. The effect was maximal between 6 and 24 hours of administration and was larger than has been noted with senna."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Larbi", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "West Afr J Pharmacol Drug Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0427176", "ISSNLinking": "0303-691X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1029909"]}}]}
