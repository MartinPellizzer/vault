In a previous work, we selected a resistant cultivar, Nufar, to address this problem. The mode of inheritance of resistance to F. oxysporum f. sp. bacilici in sweet basil was examined in progenies derived from crosses of the homogeneous resistant cv. Nufar and the susceptible homogenous cv. Chen. Artificial inoculation of seedlings with a high concentration of a microconidial suspension of a virulent isolate of F. oxysporum f. sp. bacilici revealed no difference between reciprocal backcrosses. The nuclear resistance analysis and dominant characteristics of the resistance of backcross progenies of different parental lines and the segregation for resistance in F<sub>2</sub> combinations fitted the expected Mendelian ratio for a single dominant gene with two alleles that confer resistance to Fusarium wilt in basil. These results indicate the usefulness of utilizing this resistance to F. oxysporum f.sp. bacilici in the production of new hybrids and cultivars of basil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, ARO, Newe Ya'ar Research Center, P.O.
