DC., is used in the Amazonian region of South America, wherein ethnic groups use the plant to treat diseases, including gastric disorders. However, despite its widespread popular use, this species has yet to be assessed for its anti-ulcer effects.", "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the in vivo gastroprotective and gastric healing activities of an aqueous extract of the bark of Uncaria tomentosa (AEUt) and sought to gain an understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these biological effects.", "To verify the gastroprotective properties rats were treated with AEUt (30, 60, or 120\u00a0mg/kg) prior to inducing gastric ulceration with ethanol or piroxicam. Additionally, the involvement of nitric oxide, non-protein sulfhydryl compounds (NP-SH), \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors, and prostaglandins was investigated. Furthermore, a pylorus ligature model was employed to investigate the antisecretory activity of AEUt. The gastric healing effects of AEUt (60\u00a0mg/kg) were examined in rats in which ulceration had been induced with 80% acetic acid, whereas the quality of healing was evaluated in mice with interleukin-induced recurrent ulcers. We also evaluated the in vivo thickness of the gastric wall using ultrasonography. Moreover, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated in ulcerated mucosa, and we determined the activities of the enzymes myeloperoxidase (MPO), N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glycosaminidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase. In addition, we assessed the effects of AEUt on cell viability and subjected the AEUt to phytochemical analyses.", "Administration of the AEUt (60 or 120\u00a0mg/kg) prevented ethanol- and piroxicam-induced ulceration, which was also confirmed histologically. Moreover, we observed that pre-treatment with NEM and indomethacin abolished the gastroprotective effects of AEUt, thereby indicating the involvement of NP-SH and prostaglandins in these protective effects. In addition, we found that the administration of AEUt had no appreciable effects on the volume, acidity, or peptic activity of gastric juice. Furthermore, the AEUt (60\u00a0mg/kg) accelerated the gastric healing of acetic acid-induced ulcers by 46.2% and ultrasonographic findings revealed a reduction in the gastric wall thickness in this group. The gastric healing effect of AEUt was also accompanied by a reduction in MPO activity. The AEUt (60\u00a0mg/kg) also minimized ulcer recurrence in mice exposed to IL-1\u03b2 and was associated with the maintenance of GSH levels and a reduction in MDA contents. We deduce that the biological effects of AEUt could be associated with the activities of polyphenols and the alkaloids isomitraphylline and mitraphylline, identified as predominant constituents of the AEUt. Furthermore, we found no evidence to indicate that AEUt would have any cytotoxic effects.", "Collectively, our findings provide compelling evidence indicating the therapeutic efficacy of U. tomentosa. Our data indicate that compounds in AEUt confer gastroprotection and that this preventive effect of AEUt was accompanied by gastric healing and a reduction in gastric ulcer recurrence. Moreover, we provide evidence to indicate that the gastroprotective and gastric healing effects involve the antioxidant system and anti-inflammatory responses that contribute to preserving the gastric mucosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
