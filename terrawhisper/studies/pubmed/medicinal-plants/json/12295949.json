This comprehensive scientific assessment revealed that of the 270,000 known species, 33,789 are at risk of disappearing, with 91% of these plants found in a single country. These include plants known to have medicinal value and those that provide valuable timber. The loss of each species results in less access to critical genetic material that contributes to producing harder and healthier crops for human and animal consumption. Despite this comprehensive assessment, the 12.5% figure is a conservative estimate, with species included in the research being only vascular plants. To conserve the plant species, this article emphasizes the need for more interactions between governments, scientific institutions, botanical gardens, and conservation organizations."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [["Deforestation", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Environment", "Environmental Degradation", "Environmental Impact", "Forests", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Natural Resources", "Plants, Medicinal", "World"]], "GeneralNote": ["POPEN.", "TJ: WORLD CONSERVATION"], "PMID": "12295949", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2000", "Month": "09", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998"}}, "Title": "World conservation", "ISOAbbreviation": "World Conserv"}, "ArticleTitle": "Red flag for plants.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "10", "MedlinePgn": "10"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brackett", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "World Conserv", "NlmUniqueID": "101085370"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12295949"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
