Essential oil of Cs was isolated by hydrodistillation method and chemical composition was determined by GS-MS analysis. 42 male Wistar Albino rats were divited into 7 groups each containing 6. The experimental groups were designed as: Normal control group, 1\u00a0ml/kg CCl<sub>4</sub> administirated group, 25\u00a0mg/kg Silymarin and CCl<sub>4</sub> administirated group, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg Cs and CCl<sub>4</sub> administirated groups, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg Ln and CCl<sub>4</sub> administered groups. The protective activities were determined according to the results of liver biomarkers (AST, ALT, ALP), antioxidant parameters (GSH, GPx, CAT), lipid peroxidation (MDA) and histopathological examination. Linalool percentage of Cs was 81.6%. The groups treated with linalool (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and coriander (200\u00a0mg/kg) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) had significantly reduced AST (262-375) and ALT (101-290) levels (U/L) compared to the CCl<sub>4</sub> (600-622) group. The levels (nmol/g protein) of MDA (11-12) were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), the levels of GSH (11-12) and the activities of CAT (23-24) were significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in linalool groups (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) compared to the CCl<sub>4</sub> (18-5-10 respectively) group. These results were also supported by histopathological findings and indicate that Cs and Ln shows hepatoprotective activity against liver damage. In this regard, evaluation of activities of major components are needed to compare to medicinal plants in experimental diseases models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tekirda\u011f Nam\u0131k Kemal Univ., Tekirda\u011f, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Alt\u0131nok-Yipel", "ForeName": "Fulya", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology-Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hatay Mustafa Kemal Univ., Hatay, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozan Tekeli", "ForeName": "\u0130brahim", "Initials": "\u0130"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Adnan Menderes Univ., Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zsoy", "ForeName": "\u015eule Yurdag\u00fcl", "Initials": "\u015eY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hatay Mustafa Kemal Univ., Hatay, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcven\u00e7", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of FieldCrops, Faculty of Agricultural, Hatay Mustafa Kemal Univ., Hatay, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kaya", "ForeName": "Alpaslan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology-Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tekirda\u011f Nam\u0131k Kemal Univ., Tekirda\u011f, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yipel", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Vitam Nutr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "1273304", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30932786", "10.1024/0300-9831/a000581"]}}]}
