The alpha-subunit was free from tryptophan and cysteine and the beta-subunit contained no methionine or cysteine. There was no marked resemblance in tryptic peptide map between these subunit polypeptides. The alpha-subunit contained 28% by weight of carbohydrate, mainly made up of high mannose-type oligosacharides, whereas the sugar moiety of the beta-subunit amounted to 7% by weight and seemed to be predominantly composed of xylomannose-type oligosaccharides. By SDS-PAGE following deglycosylation, the molecular weights of the polypeptides of alpha- and beta-subunits were shown to be 7,800 and 14,000, respectively. These values were consistent with molecular sizes obtained for alpha- and beta-subunits by gel permeation HPLC in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of the native PHA-I, 28,800, obtained by gel permeation HPLC under non-denaturing conditions, suggested a heterodimeric structure for PHA-I."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry, College of Agriculture, University of Osaka Prefecture."}], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1783611", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123660"]}}]}
