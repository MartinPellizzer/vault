The subjects were South Africans of Indian extraction. The study did not include haplotypes. Palpable fibrous bands in the mouth indicated oral submucous fibrosis. The subjects were divided into 4 groups based on specific oral symptoms and signs. Groups A and B were without fibrous bands. Group A (47 subjects) included those with one or no symptoms while group B (28 subjects) suffered from 2 to 7 oral symptoms. Group C (17 subjects) had oral symptoms and represented early or mild oral submucous fibrosis and exhibited at least one discrete palpable fibrous band. Group D (30 subjects) were classic oral submucous fibrosis cases with multiple bands. The high occurrence of oral submucous fibrosis in this study group (39%) is similar to the occurrence in comparable age groups reported earlier in South Africa and is conceivably due to the higher age range of the subjects and their relatively long exposure to the areca nut. We were unable to demonstrate a specific pattern of HLA-antigen frequencies in chewers with or without the disease. Furthermore, there were no differences between the study population and the controls. It is concluded that there is not necessarily a HLA-associated susceptibility in oral submucous fibrosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral and Dental Research Institute, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa."}], "LastName": "van Wyk", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grobler-Rabie", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martell", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hammond", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA-A Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA-B Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA-C Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA-D Antigens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HLA Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HLA-A Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HLA-B Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HLA-C Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HLA-D Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8138977", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1994.tb00249.x"]}}]}
