In late June 2001, a severe dieback occurred on a group of pokeweed plants being grown as ornamentals in a garden in Rome. Disease symptoms consisted of leaf wilting followed by collapse of the plant. Stem collars and roots had dark brown-to-black water-soaked lesions. A wet rot was observed on plants with advanced disease symptoms. Isolations, from sections of roots and stems previously washed in running tap water, were made on PARBhy selective medium (10 mg of pimaricin, 250 mg of ampicillin [sodium salt], 10 mg of rifampicin, 50 mg of hymexazol, 15 mg of benomyl, 15 g of malt extract, and 20 g of agar in 1,000 ml of H2O) (2), followed by incubation at 20\u00b0C. A species of Phytophthora identified based on morphological and cultural characteristics (1) was isolated consistently from rotted roots and collars of diseased plants. All isolates produced papillate, spherical, ovoid to obturbinate, noncaducous sporangia and terminal and intercalary chlamydospores. Hyphal swellings with hyphal outgrowths were present. Observed characteristics were similar to those described for P. nicotianae. Isolates were mating type A2 with amphigynous antheridia in paired cultures with the A1 tester isolate of P. nicotianae. Identification was confirmed by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA with those obtained from previously identified Phytophthora species. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 10 2-month-old potted pokeweed plants. Inoculum was prepared by inoculating sterilized millet seeds moistened with V8 broth with plugs of mycelium and growing for 4 weeks. The inoculum was added to potting soil at 3% (wt/vol), and sporulation was induced by flooding the soil for 48 h. Five uninoculated plants were used as controls. Plants were maintained outdoors and assessed for symptoms within 2 months after inoculation. Wilting, root rot, and dark brown lesions on the collar developed on inoculated plants. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated plants and morphologically identical to the original isolates, which confirmed P. nicotianae as the causal agent of the disease. Few diseases have been reported on Phytolacca decandra. This species is not only an invasive weed, but is also cultivated as an ornamental and medicinal plant. In addition, antiviral (PAP) and antifungal (Pa-AFP) proteins that are used as a remedy for several human and plant infections have been extracted from the plant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on pokeweed. References: (1) D. C. Erwin and O. K. Ribeiro. Phytophthora Diseases Worldwide.
