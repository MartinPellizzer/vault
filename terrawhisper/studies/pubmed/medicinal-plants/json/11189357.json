Results of herichical analysis showed most of trains isolated from Astragalus spp. fell into subgroups 8 and 9, Also the DNA homolgy among strains of subgroups 8 and 9 are more than 70%, with the exception of strains CA8593 and SX044, and the DNA homology between strain CA8561, JL84 and type strains of all described rhizobial species are less than 56%. These results indicated that these two subgroups 8 and 9 were unique DNA homologous groups, distinguishing from all described rhizobial species. Sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene showed that cetrostrain CA8561 of subgroup 8 is phylogenetically far from all know species of Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Azorhizobium and Agrobacterium, and it is a unique geneline. The cetrostrain JL84 of subgroup 9 has a unique position in the phylogenetic branch consisted of species of Rhizobium and Agrobacterium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological Sciences, Beijing Aricultural University, Beijing 100094."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21610860R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, RNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11189357"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
