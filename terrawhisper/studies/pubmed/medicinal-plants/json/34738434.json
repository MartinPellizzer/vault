The chemical constituents were isolated and purified by chromatographies with silica gel, RP-C_(18), Sephadex LH-20, and preparative HPLC, and their structures were determined based on the spectroscopic data and physicochemical properties, as well as relevant references. Three pairs of new dibenzoxocin derivatives were isolated from 70% ethanol extract of C. decapetala and identified as protosappanoside A(1 a), isoprotosappanoside A(1 b), protosappanoside B(2 a), isoprotosappanoside B(2 b), protosappanoside C(3 a), and isoprotosappanoside C(3 b), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Province Center for Food and Drug Evaluation and Inspection Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caesalpinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34738434", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210618.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
