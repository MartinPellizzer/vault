Understanding the mechanism regulating ABCA1 expression is important for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present study, a G-quadruplex (G4) structure was identified in the ABCA1 promoter region. This G4 was shown to be essential for ABCA1 transcription. Stabilizing the G4 by ligands surprisingly upregulated ABCA1 expression in macrophages. Knocking out the G4 remarkably reduced ABCA1 expression, and abolished the increase of ABCA1 expression induced by the G4 ligand. By pull-down assays, the protein NONO was identified as an ABCA1 G4 binder. Overexpression or repression of NONO significantly induced upregulation and downregulation of ABCA1 expression, respectively. ChIP and EMSA experiments showed that the G4 ligand promoted the binding between the ABCA1 G4 and NONO, which led to more recruitment of NONO to the promoter region and enhanced ABCA1 transcription. Finally, the G4 ligand was shown to significantly reduce the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages. This study showed a new insight into the regulation of gene expression by G4, and provided a new molecular mechanism regulating ABCA1 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, the study showed a possible novel application of the G4 ligand: preventing and treating atherosclerosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
