Contrasperm is claimed to be a pure botanical extract free of toxic chemicals, steroids, and hormones. The drug is believed to cause cells surrounding the sperm in the seminiferous tubules to secrete carbon dioxide, producing a weakly acidic environment that greatly increases the sperms' metabolism and reduces the pH of semen from its normal level of 7.5 to 1.5. The manufacturer claims that this drop in pH decreases motility from 95% to 0%. Semen samples were collected by masturbation from subjects to provide baseline data. 3 days after the initial sperm analysis, subjects were given 1 capsule of Contrasperm containing 10 mcg of the active ingredient. Additional semen analyses were conducted 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after ingestion. Sperm count and sperm motility were greatly reduced in most subjects 30 minutes after ingestion. However, 6 subjects had increased sperm counts and 4 subjects demonstrated increased sperm motility, indicating an enhancing effect. At 6 hours after ingestion, 20 subjects had lowered sperm motility and 12 subjects showed normal sperm motility, contradicting the manufacturer's claim that motility is reduced to 0%. Although Contrasperm is claimed to be effective for 6-8 hours after ingestion, its effect wore off in less than 6 hours in 37% of subjects. Both sperm count and sperm motility returned to normal levels 24 hours after ingestion, confirming the reversibility of this drug. Most subjects reported mild side effects such as muscle weakness, blurred vision, dizziness, perspiration, urgency, abnormal muscle tension, and dry throat which persisted longer than 24 hours. Further studies, with proper controls, are needed to assess the reliability and toxicity of this preparation."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["028108", "00139053"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Biology", "Contraception--men", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Contraceptive Usage", "Cytologic Effects", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Examinations And Diagnoses", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses", "Laboratory Procedures", "Malaysia", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research Report", "Reversibility", "Southeastern Asia", "Sperm Count--changes", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Theoretical Effectiveness"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12279893", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "04", "Day": "12"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0127-3213", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Jan"}}, "Title": "Malaysian journal of reproductive health : a publication of the Reproductive Research Centre of the National Population and Family Development Board, Malaysia", "ISOAbbreviation": "Malays J Reprod Health"}, "ArticleTitle": "Efficacy of Contrasperm as a male contraceptive: clinical trials in Malaysian men.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "75", "EndPage": "82", "MedlinePgn": "75-82"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamid", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaffar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Malays J Reprod Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8804319", "ISSNLinking": "0127-3213"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermatocidal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Laboratory Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocidal Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12279893"]}}]}
