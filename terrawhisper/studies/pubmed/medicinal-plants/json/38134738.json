Based on the genomic and transcriptomic data of Salvia miltiorrhiza, the SmCXE family was systematically analyzed using bioinformatics. The results revealed 34 SmCXE family members in S. miltiorrhiza, and the SmCXE family could be divided into five groups (Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V). Cis-regulatory elements indicated that the SmCXE promoter region contained tissue-specific and development-related, hormone-related, stress-related, and photoresponsive elements. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression levels of SmCXE2 were highest in roots and flowers (SmCXE8 was highest in stems and SmCXE19 was highest in leaves). Further, two GA receptors SmCXE1 (SmGID1A) and SmCXE2 (SmGID1B) were isolated from the SmCXE family, which are homologous to other plants. SmGID1A and SmGID1B have conserved HGGSF motifs and active amino acid sites (Ser-Asp-Val/IIe), which are required to maintain their GA-binding activities. SmGID1A and SmGID1B were significantly responsive to gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. A subcellular assay revealed that SmCXE1 and SmCXE2 resided within the nucleus. SmGID1B can interact with SmDELLAs regardless of whether GA<sub>3</sub> exists, whereas SmGID1A can only interact with SmDELLAs in the presence of GA<sub>3</sub>. A Further assay showed that the GRAS domain mediated the interactions between SmGID1s and SmDELLAs. This study lays a foundation for further elucidating the role of SmCXE in the growth and development of S. miltiorrhiza."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
