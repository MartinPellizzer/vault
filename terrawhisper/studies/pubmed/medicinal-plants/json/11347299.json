At the moment, its beneficial effect (which is proportional to the type of fiber consumed) has been widely demonstrated for its action on related diseases. The purpose of this paper was to prove that thermal treatment modifies the content of Total Dietetic Fiber (TDF). Soluble Dietetic Fiber (SDF) and Insoluble Dietetic Fiber (IDF) in lentil (Lens culinaris) and black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), both species of high intake in the country, especially in Caracas. The determination of TDF and its fractions (SDF and IDF) was performed through the application of the gravimetric enzymatic method (21). The results indicate significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis Test 95% of confidence) in the contents of TDF and its fractions, between the crude legumes and those subject to thermal treatment. The IDF was predominant in all cases and according to its positive effects-apparently favors the consumers of these legumes. On the basis of these findings, it is considered important to continue the analysis of the TDFs constituents generated after the cooking of these legumes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de los Andes, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alfonzo Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Efecto del tratamiento t\u00e9rmico sobre el contenido de fibra diet\u00e9tica total, soluble e insoluble en algunas leguminosas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11347299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
