Assessment of the extract was carried out by calculating oocysts count in fecal samples, in addition to histopathological and electron microscopic examination of intestinal mucosa..", "There was a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of oocyst shedding more in high dose than low dose Citrus-treated mice group till negligible numbers of oocysts were found at day 22nd post infection. Histopathologically, the intestinal tissues from high dose Citrus-treated group showed improvement of the pathological changes, the villi retained their normal appearance with minimal inflammatory cells in comparison to infected control mice groups. Also, ultra-structurally, the high dose Citrus-treated mice showed few Cryptosporidium trophozoites, while moderate number of parasitic stages and mucous in the low dose Citrus-treated mice, and large numbers of parasitic stages with sever mucous in the control infected non-treated mice epithelium.", "Our study established for the first time that Citrus sinensis is a promising natural candidate that could be efficiently used for developing of new anti-cryptospordial drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
