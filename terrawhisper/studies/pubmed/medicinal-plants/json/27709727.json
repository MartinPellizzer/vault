Keiss. pathogen. Total polyphenolic content and antioxidant potential showed a significant decrease during leaf spot disease. Evaluation of pharmaceutically active constituents withaferin A, withanone and withanolide A utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography showed a significant decrease in diseased samples as compared to healthy ones. Quantitative expression of major genes involved in withanolide biosynthesis also showed down-regulation in diseased samples. Alterations in the ultra-structure of chloroplasts were also analysed under transmission electron microscopy to get a better insight into the changes of withanolide biosynthesis in leaf during disease infestation.", "The present work suggests that when the pathogenic fungus invades the host plants, it evokes multiple responses, which could be studied at various levels. The knowledge gained from this work will provide appropriate rationale for controlling the bio-deterioration of the pharmaceutically active metabolites in W. somnifera and development of suitable strategies against leaf spot disease.", "This is the first study to investigate the effect of leaf spot disease on the human health-promoting constituents and withanolide biosynthesis in this high-valued medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "QC & QA, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu Tawi, Jammu and Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Chaudhary Devi Lal University, Sirsa, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Salar", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Hallan", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Pati", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["HQ293119.1", "HM855234.1", "GU181386.1", "GU574803.1", "HM037907.1", "FJ560880.2", "GU808569.1", "JQ710678.1", "JQ710679.1", "XM006354277.2", "AF126551.1"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Withanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GY036XA633", "NameOfSubstance": "withanone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Alternaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Withanolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27709727", "10.1111/jam.13314"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
