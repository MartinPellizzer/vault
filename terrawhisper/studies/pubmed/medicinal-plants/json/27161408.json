The aim of this study was to prove the in vivo efficacy of Gegen on improving detrusor overactivity and its possible synergism with darifenacin (a first-line muscarinic receptor-3 inhibitor) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a rat model exhibiting symptoms of detrusor overactivity.", "After daily oral administration of Gegen 30 (Gegen, 30mg/kg); Gegen 300 (Gegen, 300mg/kg); Low_Dar (darifenacin, 3mg/kg); High_Dar (darifenacin, 30mg/kg) Low_Dar+Gegen 30 or High_Dar+Gegen 30 for 3 weeks, bladder detrusor strips of the rats were isolated and assessed with different stimulators for the measurement of tonic and phasic contractile activities (including phasic amplitude and frequency). Modes of stimulation included the use of carbachol, isoprenaline and electrical field stimulation (EFS).", "All drug treatments significantly reduced carbachol-stimulated tonic contractile activities, but did not change the phasic amplitude. Meanwhile, the treatments with Gegen 300; Low_Dar; Low_Dar+Gegen 30; and High_Dar+Gegen 30 decreased carbachol-stimulated phasic frequency. Gegen 300 and Low_Dar+Gegen 30 showed stronger potency on lowering EFS-induced responses. Under isoprenaline-induced relaxation, only Gegen 300 significantly enhanced this relaxation by decreasing tonic contraction; Gegen 300; Low_Dar; Low_Dar+Gegen 30; and High_Dar+Gegen 30 increased the reduction of phasic frequency, but all treatment did not alter their phasic amplitude. Combination Index (CI) showed that the combination with Low_Dar and Gegen 30 had very strong synergism (CI <0.1) on inhibiting EFS-induced contractile response.", "Gegen improved detrusor overactivity through neurogenic and anti-muscarinic mechanisms.
