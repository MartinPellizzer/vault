The increasing popularity in plant-based drugs is leading to a fast growing market for plant-based drugs pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, functional foods, and even cosmeceuticals. <i>Objective:</i> The development of authentic analytical methods for complex herbal drugs, especially poly herbal formulations which can reliably profile the phytochemical composition, including quantitative analyses of marker/bioactive compounds and other major constituents, is a major challenge to scientists. Standardization is an important step for the establishment of a consistent biological activity, a consistent chemical profile, or simply a quality assurance program for production and manufacturing of herbal drugs. <i>Methods/Results:</i> HPLC as a tool has been widely used in the standardization of complex herbal drugs because of its ability to estimate the presence of active (chemical or biological) markers both qualitatively and quantitatively. <i>Conclusions:</i> An overview of various HPLC techniques that can be used for standardization of herbal drugs has been presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research & Development Zydus Wellness Ltd, House No. 6 & 7, Sigma Commerce Zone, Nr.
