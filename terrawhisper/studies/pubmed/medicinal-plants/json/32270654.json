These plant species have medicinal properties and are being used in South Africa by traditional healers as so-called \"muti.\" All plant species showed a suppressive effect. Relative to untreated control, the soil amendments consistently suppressed <i>M. incognita</i> population densities in tomato roots and the reproductive potential (RP) of the nematode. When compared to fenamiphos, a commercial systemic chemical nematicide, the soil amendments performed comparable or better in suppressing nematode populations in the root systems in 2008 and 2009, but fenamiphos performed better than all soil amendments in 2011. The RP of <i>M. incognita</i> was comparable for both soil amendment- and fenamiphos-treated plants. No consistent trend in the effect of the soil amendments on plant root and shoot bioweight was observed, except when plants were treated with <i>T. elegans</i>-based soil amendments and both root and shoot bioweight were consistently higher compared with untreated control plants.
