In most cultivars PHA makes up 5-10% of the total seed protein, but certain cultivars do not contain PHA. In vivo labeling of a normal cultivar (Greensleeves) and a PHA-minus cultivar (Pinto 111) showed that PHA was not synthesized in the PHA-minus cultivar. To find out whether the lack of synthesis was due to the absence of mRNA for PHA, recombinant cDNA clones for PHA were obtained. Total poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from cotyledons of developing seeds of Greensleeves and used to direct cDNA synthesis. The double stranded cDNA was cloned in pUC8 and transformants of Escherichia coli screened with pPVL134, a recombinant plasmid which contains the complete coding sequence for a PHA-like protein. Two weakly hybridizing clones (pSC1 and pSC2) were selected. Hybrid selection experiments showed that these two clones selected mRNAs which could be translated into polypeptides identical in size to PHA and recognized by antibodies to PHA. The recombinant pPVL134 selected mRNA which translated into polypeptides which were slightly smaller than those of PHA, and poorly recognized by antibodies to PHA. The recombinant clones were used to demonstrate that the genes for PHA and for the PHA-like protein are under temporal control during seed development. The cultivar Pinto 111, which has no detectable PHA, also has greatly reduced levels of mRNA for PHA. However, the gene for the PHA-like protein encoded by pPVL134 is expressed to the same degree in the cultivars Greensleeves and Pinto 111."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Staswick", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chrispeels", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Appl Genet", "NlmUniqueID": "8109497", "ISSNLinking": "0271-6801"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6530601"]}}]}
