Biological <i>in vitro</i> investigations included antibacterial testing, cell viability analysis\u00a0and cell attachment evaluation. <i>In vivo</i> experiments, including the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) test, were conducted to assess wound-healing efficacy and histopathological changes. <b>Results:</b> The incorporation of <i>Ast</i> to the silk fibroin@ chitosan/ZnO scaffold improved wound healing in diabetic mice. In addition, seeding of ADSCs on the scaffold accelerated wound healing. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that the designed scaffold can be useful for skin regeneration applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0003-0563-3886"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Technologies, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3054-1767"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Research, Iranian Academic Center for Education, Culture & Research (ACECR), Khorasan Razavi Branch, Mashhad, 9177-948974, Iran."}], "LastName": "Molavi", "ForeName": "Amir Mahdi", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4302-6270"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products & Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amani", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0008-5578-876X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moqadam", "ForeName": "Kurosh Hamzanlui", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8656-1981"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomical Sciences School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vatanchian", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5161-4289"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vector-borne Diseases Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd,74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6849-6853"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Technologies, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products & Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 74877-94149, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oroojalian", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "4000254", "Agency": "North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanomedicine (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "101278111", "ISSNLinking": "1743-5889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38293919", "10.2217/nnm-2023-0311"]}}]}
