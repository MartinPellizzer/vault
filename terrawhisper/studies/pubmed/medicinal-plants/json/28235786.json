Data were collected on animal exposure calls to German poison centres, poisoning cases presenting to the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover Small Animal and Equine Clinics, cases involving off-label use of veterinary medicinal products reported to the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety and toxicological submissions to the Institute of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise animal type, exposure reason, type and substance, year/month of exposure, case severity and outcome. An evaluation of the data and data sources was also carried out. Variation in poisoning patterns was seen. However, dogs and cats were the most frequently reported species and medicinal products, pesticides and plants were consistently implicated as top causes of poisoning. Advantages and disadvantages were associated with each data source; bias was found to be an important consideration when evaluating poisoning data. This study provided useful information on animal poisonings in Germany and highlights the need for standardised approaches for the collection, evaluation and integration of poisoning data from multiple sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "British Veterinary Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Exposure, Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "McFarland", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Small Animal Clinic, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation, Hannover, Germany."}], "LastName": "Mischke", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinic for Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation, Hannover, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hopster-Iversen", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Drugs Department, Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Safety, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "von Krueger", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ammer", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Potschka", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Society of Clinical Toxicology, Mainz, Germany."}], "LastName": "St\u00fcrer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Exposure, Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Begemann", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Exposure, Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Desel", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Exposure, Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Virtual Centre for Animal Health and Food Quality, University of Veterinary Medicine, Foundation, Hannover, Germany."}], "LastName": "Greiner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Vet Rec", "NlmUniqueID": "0031164", "ISSNLinking": "0042-4900"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Veterinary Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Horses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Livestock"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Off-Label Use"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Poison Control Centers"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poultry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Veterinary Drugs"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28235786", "10.1136/vr.103973", "vr.103973"]}}]}
