Then, a highly sensitive non-enzymatic salvianic acid A (SAA) electrochemical sensor was fabricated by modifying HKUST-1\u00a0@\u00a0(RGO-MWCNT) on a glassy carbon electrode, taking full advantage of the synergistic effect between the redox catalytic capacity of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and the electrical conductivity of carbon materials. The sensor showed a low limit of detection of 0.081\u00a0\u03bcM, limit of quantitation of 0.27\u00a0\u03bcM, high sensitivity of 509.6\u00a0\u03bcA/mM and a good relationship between reduction peak current and concentration of SAA from 2 to 4600\u00a0\u03bcM. Meanwhile, the sensor had the advantages of repeatability and stability. Finally, it was used to detect SAA in real samples with noteworthy electroanalytical performance. In short, the sensor has considerable potential for the electroanalysis of SAA. Moreover, the study provides a promising composite of MOF and carbon materials with potential application in the analysis of effective components of herbaceous medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
