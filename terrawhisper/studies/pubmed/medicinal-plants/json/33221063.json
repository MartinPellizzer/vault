In the present study, the anti-tumor efficacy was investigated and it showed broad-spectrum activity against several cancer cell lines, especially metastatic colorectal cancer (HCT116, SW620, T84) with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.2, 5.9, 8.2\u00a0nM, respectively, roughly equal to well-known anti-tumor agent docetaxel (4.0, 4.7, 2.7\u00a0nM) and nearly 1000 folds than CPT-11 (4.4, 5.1, 6.9\u00a0\u03bcM). Furthermore, neothalfine inhibited colorectal cell proliferation by resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis through the dysfunction of mitochondria to trigger intrinsic apoptotic pathway by untargeted metabolomic method, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3/7 activity assay. Moreover, neothalfine damaged colorectal cancer clonal spheres expansion significantly at the concentration of 3.5\u00a0nM with nearly 1000 folds efficacy than CPT-11 (3.0\u00a0\u00b5M). The results supported that neothalfine might be an anti-tumor lead for further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
