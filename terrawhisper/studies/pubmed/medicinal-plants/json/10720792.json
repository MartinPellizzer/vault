Changing in salivary pH and buffer capacity during the experimental period were also measured. Thirty human subjects participated in this study. At each experimental session, a pretest saliva sample was taken. After giving the pretest samples, the subjects rinsed with S. asper leaf extract or distilled water control for 60 s, then the post-test saliva samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 and 6 h. The samples were used to determine the numbers of S. mutans and total salivary bacteria. The results indicated that S. asper leaf extract significantly reduced S. mutans counts compared with distilled water. However, the mean difference from baseline of total salivary bacterial counts was not significantly different between rinsing with S. asper leaf extract and distilled water. Moreover, S. asper leaf extract showed no effects in modifying the salivary pH and buffer capacity. It is concluded that of mouthrinse containing S. asper leaf extract can reduce S. mutans without changing an oral ecology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Diagnosis, Faculty of Dentistry, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. suvi_taw@kku1.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taweechaisupapong", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wongkham", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chareonsuk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suparee", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Srilalai", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaiyarak", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Buffers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mouthwashes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Buffers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mouthwashes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10720792", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00140-3", "S0378-8741(99)00140-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
