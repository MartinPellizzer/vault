Iglesias, et al. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 123, 247-252] was shown by equilibrium dialysis to be bivalent for 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside. Upon binding to the lectin, this ligand showed a difference absorption spectrum with two maxima (at 322 and 336 nm) of equal intensity (delta epsilon = 1.2 X 10(3) M-1 cm-1). A similar spectrum with a comparable value of delta epsilon was obtained with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminide. Binding of methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine all produced small but equally intense protein difference spectra with a maximum (delta epsilon = 2.8 X 10(2) M-1 cm-1) at 291.6 nm. Upon binding of N-dansyl-D-galactosamine to the lectin, there was a fivefold increase in fluorescence intensity of this ligand. The association constant for N-dansyl-D-galactosamine was caused by a very favorable delta S degree of the dansyl group without affecting the strictly carbohydrate-specific character of binding. N-Dansyl-D-galactosamine was employed as a fluorescent indicator ligand in substitution titrations. This involved the use of simple carbohydrates, N-acetyllactosamine, and oligosaccharides which occur in the carbohydrate units of N-glycoproteins; the latter were Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)Man, Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)Man, and Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)[Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)]Man. The titrations were performed at two temperatures to determine the thermodynamic parameters. In the series N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, and lactose, -delta H degrees increased from 24 to 41 kJ mol-1; it increased further for N-acetyllactosamine and then remained unchanged for the N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides (55 +/- 1 kJ mol-1. This indicated that the site specifically accommodated the disaccharide structure with an important contribution of the 2-acetamido group in the penultimate sugar. Beyond this, no additional contacts seemed to be formed. This conclusion also followed from considerations of delta S degrees values which became more unfavorable in the above series (-23 to -101 +/- 4 J mol-1 K-1); the most negative value of delta S degrees was observed with N-acetyllactosamine and the three N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Boeck", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Loontiens", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lis", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharon", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Sugars"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dansyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3Y5B2K5OOK", "NameOfSubstance": "N-acetyllactosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7535-00-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "78617-03-5", "NameOfSubstance": "dansylgalactosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Sugars"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dansyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Galectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6548353", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90352-7", "0003-9861(84)90352-7"]}}]}
