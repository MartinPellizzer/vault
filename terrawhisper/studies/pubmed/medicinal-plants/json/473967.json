The isolates of the fungus were obtained from distant geographical regions of Czechoslovakia and from various cultivars and hybrids of pea. After inoculation of roots, followed by constant conditions of incubation of the Meteor and Jupiter cultivars having their origin at the Plant-breeding Station at Luzany u Prestic, the isolates caused various symptoms of disease, each isolate showed a different degree of pathogenity. The variability of the pathogenity of the isolates depended on the host. Its manifestation, in turn, depended on the dynamics of growth and development of the pathogen as well as the host. The following symptoms could be observed during the pathogenesis: the dying of cotyledons after the contact of the main root with the inoculum, the dying of young plants (the plants usually forming two stems), wilting of young plants, yellowing of bottom leaves and wilting beginning from the bottom leaves, stunted growth, and plant deformation. The symptoms of disease are related to the changes in vascular system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kov\u00e1cikov\u00e1", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kr\u00e1tk\u00e1", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Bakteriol Naturwiss", "NlmUniqueID": "8000422", "ISSNLinking": "0323-6056"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Czechoslovakia"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["473967", "10.1016/s0323-6056(79)80043-9"]}}]}
