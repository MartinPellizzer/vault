In this context, medicinal plants as promising therapeutic candidates can provide a reliable and efficient profile. Since free radicals are at the center of various disorder pathways, reducing their production or complete removal of these chemical species could be advantageous for prevention and treatment of many diseases. In this experiment, free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of Veronica persica Poir., a known medicinal plant, were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Chemical characterization results showed a high phenolic content in the V. persica methanol extract. In addition, in vitro assays including DPPH radical-scavenging assay, nitric oxide-scavenging activity assay, hydrogen peroxide scavenging test and bleomycin-dependent DNA damage test revealed significant antioxidant power and radical scavenging capacity of this plant. In accordance, in vivo experiments showed inhibitory effects of the methanol extract on lipid peroxidation, a main cause of cell damage. Our findings revealed the promising potential of this plant in reducing free radicals through different pathways. Moreover, our data suggested a correlation between the high phenolic content of the V. persica extract and its free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, 61663335 Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Ethics and Law Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Bahare", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Milan State University, 20133 Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Iriti", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roointan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Lebanese University, Beirut 6573, Lebanon."}], "LastName": "Mnayer", "ForeName": "Dima", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Soltani-Nejad", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department Rangeland and Watershed, Faculty of Water and Soil, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Veronica"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29981684"]}}]}
