Presently, drug discovery and development have adopted rational approaches to explore herbal resources for treating lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes. For the treatment of diabetes, <i>Curcumin longa</i> has been extensively studied for evaluation of its antidiabetic potential using various <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models. Literature resources such as PubMed and Google Scholar have been extensively searched to collect documented studies. Various parts of the plant and extracts have proven antidiabetic effects, namely, anti-hyperglycemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory action, through different mechanisms. It is reported that the plant extract or its phytoconstituents regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. The reported study concluded the diversified antidiabetic role of <i>C. longa</i> and its phytoconstituents and, thus, its potential use as an antidiabetic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, KIET School of Pharmacy, KIET Group of Institutions, Delhi-NCR, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kaushik", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Masand", "ForeName": "Neeraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section on Medicinal Chemistry, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA/NIH), MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Iyer", "ForeName": "Malliga R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, KIET School of Pharmacy, KIET Group of Institutions, Delhi-NCR, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Vaishali M", "Initials": "VM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37132313", "10.2174/1568026623666230428101440", "CTMC-EPUB-131299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
