Establishment of the project was preceded by a comprehensive search of the literature, including the following sources: 1) articles on medical botany; 2) reports of testing crude plant extracts for fertility regulating purposes; 3) reports of in vitro effects of plant extracts; and 4) reports of a limited number of experimental studies in human subjects. The limitations of these sources of data are discussed. Information on 3000 plants was collected and computerized, using a weighting system, in order to assign priorities on the plant substances most promising for further study. The 6 centers will then procede to initiate pharmacological and chemical studies on the priority substances. Both male and female antifertility agents are included in the study."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["002311", "00087207"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Computer Programs And Programming", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Health", "Health Services", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Male Contraception", "Measurement", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reliability", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Statistics", "Technology", "Who"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "308402", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "13"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0042-9686", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "56", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1978"}}, "Title": "Bulletin of the World Health Organization", "ISOAbbreviation": "Bull World Health Organ"}, "ArticleTitle": "Fertility regulating agents from plants.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "343", "EndPage": "352", "MedlinePgn": "343-52"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soejarto", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bingel", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Slaytor", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Farnsworth", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Bull World Health Organ", "NlmUniqueID": "7507052", "ISSNLinking": "0042-9686"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Pharm Sci Support Public Health. 1976 Mar-Apr;148(2):46-52", "ArticleIdList": ["984178"]}, {"Citation": "J Pharm Sci. 1975 May;64(5):717-54", "ArticleIdList": ["1151641"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["308402", "PMC2395591"]}}]}
