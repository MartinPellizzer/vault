These plants, including Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer, have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral, and immune-enhancing properties.", "Although various species of the Guarea genus are known for their medicinal properties, comprehensive data on their anti-inflammatory effects remain limited. Therefore, we investigated the NLRP3 inflammasome-inhibiting effects of the Guarea genus in this study.", "To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of 18 members of the Guarea genus, we treated NLRP3 inflammasome activators with their extracts in LPS-primed J774A.1 and THP-1\u00a0cells. Cell viability was determined by water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) and cytokine production, protein expression, and nuclear fractionation were determined by western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization were measured using confocal microscopic analysis. Inflammation-induced zebrafish was used in the in vivo experiments.", "Among the 18 Guarea members tested, Guarea microcarpa C. DC. extract (GM) exhibited no cytotoxicity and specifically suppressed the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but not of the AIM2 or NLRC4 inflammasomes, by inhibiting the ATPase activity of NLRP3. This was achieved without affecting NF-\u03baB signaling, potassium efflux, or intracellular ROS production, all of which are involved in NLRP3 activation. The reduced ATPase activity of NLRP3 led to decreased ASC oligomerization. Furthermore, GM exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Additionally, GM treatment alleviated inflammation at the organismal level in an LPS-induced inflammation model using zebrafish embryos.", "Our results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of GM via suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, GM can be a potential therapeutic candidate for various inflammatory diseases caused by aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
