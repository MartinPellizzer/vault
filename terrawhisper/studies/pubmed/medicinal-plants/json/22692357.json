The medicinal plants selected were leaves of Apium graveolens (saderi), Averrhoa bilimbi (belimbing buluh), Centella asiatica (pegaga), Mentha arvensis (pudina), Psidium guajava (jambu batu), Sauropus androgynous (cekor manis), Solanum nigrum (terung meranti) and Polygonum minus (kesum ). Results revealed that both type and conditions of the drying treatments affected retention of all phytochemicals analysed. Herbal preparation developed using oven drying was found to have inferior phytochemicals content compared to that obtained by freeze dryer. Nevertheless, the herbal preparation developed using all treatments still retain appreciable amount of phytochemicals studied, especially carotenoids, ascorbic acid, niacin and riboflavin and thus have potential for commercial purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mahanom", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Azizah", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dzulkifly", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Malays J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "101286655", "ISSNLinking": "1394-035X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22692357"]}}]}
