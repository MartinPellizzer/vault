To date, there is still no available clinical treatment for VaD. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin (GAS) is known for its neuroprotective effects, but the role and mechanisms of action on VD remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the neuroprotective role and underlying mechanisms of GAS on chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated VaD rats and hypoxia-induced injury of HT22\u00a0cells. The study showed that GAS relieved learning and memory deficits, ameliorated hippocampus histological lesions in VaD rats. Additionally, GAS down-regulated LC3II/I, Beclin-1 levels and up-regulated P62 level in VaD rats and hypoxia-injured HT22\u00a0cells. Notably, GAS rescued the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins expression, which regulates autophagy. Mechanistic studies verify that YP-740, a PI3K agonist, significantly resulted in inhibition of excessive autophagy and apoptosis with no significant differences were observed in the YP-740 and GAS co-treatment. Meantime, we found that LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, substantially abolished GAS-mediated neuroprotection. These results revealed that the effects of GAS on VaD are related to stimulating PI3K/AKT pathway-mediated autophagy, suggesting a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for VaD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
