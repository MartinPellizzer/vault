Well known experimental research demonstrates that oxidative stress is a main cause of cell death. A high concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species leads to damage of a lot of proteins, lipids and also DNA. Synthetic compounds used for the treatment in the neurodegenerative diseases failed to meet the hopes they had raised and often exhibit a number of side effects. Therefore, in recent years interest in natural compounds derived from plants appears to be on the rise. This review describes a few natural compounds (1MeTIQ, resveratrol, curcumin, vitamin C and Gingko biloba) which revealed neuroprotective potential both in experimental studies and clinical trials. 1MeTIQ has a privileged position because, as opposed to the remaining compounds, it is an endogenous amine synthesized in human and animal brain. Based on evidence from research, it seems that a common protective mechanism for all the above-mentioned natural compounds relies on their ability to inhibit or even scavenge the excess of free radicals generated in oxidative and neurotoxin-induced processes in nerve cells of the brain. However, it was demonstrated that further different molecular processes connected with neurotoxicity (e.g. the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, activation of caspase-3, apoptosis) follow later and are initiated by the reactive oxygen species. What is more, these natural compounds are able to inhibit further stages of apoptosis triggered by neurotoxins in the brain."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
