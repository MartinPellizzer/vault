For this purpose, a monolithic fiber of metal organic framework MIL-Al (53)-deep eutectic solvent (DES)/molecularly imprinted polymers (MOF-DES/MIP) was synthesized. To find optimum microextraction conditions gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used and the influences of effective variables were investigated using one factor at a time method. After that, the significant variables were optimized using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) combined with a desirability function (DF). Under optimized conditions (desorption solvent=1500\u00a0\u00b5L of 1-octanol, pH=3.5, extraction time=35\u00a0min, [NaCl]=0% w/v and stirring rate=600\u00a0rpm), calibration graphs of analytes were linear in a concentration range of 0.1-400\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> with correlation coefficients >\u00a00.9966. Limits of detection and quantification were in the ranges of 0.023-0.033\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.088-0.113\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. This procedure was successfully employed in determining target analytes in spiked and unspiked unauthorized medicinal supplement samples with recoveries ranging from 95.14 to 104.63%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
