(Ashwagandha) leaf extract is traditionally used in managing and treating bacterial infections. A combination of experimental and computational methods was used to investigate the related antibacterial mechanism. Leaf extract showed strong antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i>. Moreover, molecular docking established that withanolide C, a compound obtained from methanolic leaf extract binded strongly to DNA gyrase enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulation and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area binding free energy suggested withanolide C to be stable at the active site of DNA gyrase B. The compound binded in a different fashion as compared to chlorobiocin a known DNA gyrase inhibitor. Present finding suggests that the antibacterial activity of <i>W. somnifera</i> is due to inhibition of DNA gyrase by withanolide C. This finding serves as the basis for development of novel antimicrobial agents.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
