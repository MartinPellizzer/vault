One particulate hexokinase (the major hexose-6-kinase fraction) and two soluble hexokinase fractions (the minor portion), as well as a soluble fructo-6-kinase fraction, were initially separated. From chromatography, electrophoresis and kinetic studies, no evidence for a specific manno-kinase was obtained. This and the level and kinetic behaviour of the particulate hexokinase implicated it as the enzyme catalysing the phosphorylation of released D-mannose. The fructo-kinase activity was further separated into three fractions. Kinetic studies on one of these with native and synthetic substrates indicated that the structural requirements for the monosaccharide substrate were a beta-D-anomeric 2-OH in the furanose ring, a 4-OH trans to the D-5-CH2OH and a -CH2OH substituent on C2 (trans to the 5-CH2OH) which could be modified. The orientation of the hydroxyl on C-3 had only a limited effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}], "LastName": "Myers", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matheson", "ForeName": "N K", "Initials": "NK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructokinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexokinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "fructokinase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cotyledon"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructokinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexokinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7765665", "10.1016/s0031-9422(00)89510-2", "S0031-9422(00)89510-2"]}}]}
