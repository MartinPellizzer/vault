Association mapping analysis (AMA) is supported as the preferred method for identifying genetic markers associated with complex traits. Our study aimed to identify molecular markers associated with two anthocyanin content and six seed coat color traits in near-isogenic lines (NILs) of colored waxy maize assessed through AMA. We performed AMA for 285 SSR loci and two anthocyanin content and six seed coat color traits in 10 NILs of colored waxy maize. In the analysis of population structure and cluster formation, the two parental lines (HW3, HW9) of \"Mibaek 2ho\" variety waxy maize and the 10 NILs were clearly divided into two groups, with each group containing one of the two parental inbred lines. In the AMA, 62 SSR markers were associated with two seed anthocyanin content and six seed coat color traits in the 10 NILs. All the anthocyanin content and seed coat color traits were associated with SSR markers, ranging from 2 to 12 SSR markers per characteristic. The 12 SSR markers were together associated with both of the two anthocyanin content (kuromanin and peonidin) traits. Our current results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR analysis for the examination of genetic diversity, relationships, and population structure and AMA in 10 NILs of colored waxy maize and the two parental lines of the \"Mibaek 2ho\" variety waxy maize."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Tae Hyeon", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hyeon", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosystems Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Nam-Wook", "Initials": "NW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Jungeun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9088-5978"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosystems Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Changyeun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maize Research Institute, Gangwon State Agricultural Research and Extension Services, Hongcheon 25160, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Si-Hwan", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maize Research Institute, Gangwon State Agricultural Research and Extension Services, Hongcheon 25160, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jae-Keun", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maize Research Institute, Gangwon State Agricultural Research and Extension Services, Hongcheon 25160, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Ki Jin", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8286-4851"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, College of Ecology & Environmental Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Sangju 37224, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Sa", "ForeName": "Kyu Jin", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2769-0799"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Program in Smart Agriculture, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ju Kyong", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Plants (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101596181", "ISSNLinking": "2223-7747"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124244", "10.3390/plants13152126", "plants13152126"]}}]}
