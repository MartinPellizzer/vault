Eighty-eight broiler chickens were divided into five groups. Birds from three groups were inoculated with velogenic ND virus strain, whereas birds from two groups were left as controls. Two groups received a mixture of the plant extract three days prior to inoculation and birds from one group were given the plant extract for two days following development of clinical signs. Blood samples were collected for haemaglutination inhibition tests (HI) for detection of ND virus antibodies. Body weights were monitored during the experiment. Three birds died from the group that was inoculated with ND virus and treated with the plant extract; two died from the group that received the plant extract as a prophylaxis and inoculated with ND virus; and one bird died from the group that was inoculated with ND virus but not given the plant extract. No death was observed in any of the birds in the control groups. Antibody titers for ND virus rose four-fold in the inoculated birds but remained low in the un-inoculated groups. Mean body weights of birds in group B declined markedly compared to the other groups. The results indicated that there was no prophylactic or therapeutic value of the plant extract against ND. The plant extract showed a negative effect on body weights in birds with ND."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mtambo", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mushi", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinabo", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda-Machang'u", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mwamengele", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yongolo", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Temu", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10624862", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00032-x", "S0378-8741(99)00032-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
