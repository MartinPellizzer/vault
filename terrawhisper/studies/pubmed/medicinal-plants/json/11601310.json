The plating efficiency(PE) of the third generation of suspension culture cells was found to be the highest one and the PE of the medium solidified with phytagel was found to be almost the same as that of the medium solidified with low melting agarose gel. Solid-solid double layer culture was found to promote the PE of Taxus cuspidata cells moderately. A large number of stable cell lines with high growth rate were obtained and the browning problem of cells was completely solved via plate culture of the cell clones of T. cuspidata. The growth rate of the best cell line reached 0.4 g.FW/g.FW.d."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Organism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11601310"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
