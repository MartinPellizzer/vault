However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the molecular mechanism of host alternation was explored through a large-scale gene expression analysis of the mealy aphid Hyalopterus persikonus on winter and summer host plants. More than four times as many unigenes of the mealy aphid were significantly upregulated on summer host Phragmites australis than on winter host Rosaceae plants. In order to identify gene candidates related to host alternation, the differentially expressed unigenes of H. persikonus were compared to salivary gland expressed genes and secretome of Acyrthosiphon pisum. Genes involved in ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation and with molecular functions of heme-copper terminal oxidase activity, hydrolase activity and ribosome binding were potentially upregulated in salivary glands of H. persikonus on the summer host. Putative secretory proteins, such as detoxification enzymes (carboxylesterases and cytochrome P450s), antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), glutathione peroxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cadherin, and calreticulin, were highly expressed in H. persikonus on the summer host, while a SCP GAPR-1-like family protein and a salivary sheath protein were highly expressed in the aphids on winter hosts. These results shed light on phenotypic plasticity in host utilization and seasonal adaptation of aphids."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects & Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Peng-Cheng", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects & Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects & Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects & Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Insect Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101266965", "ISSNLinking": "1672-9609"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insect Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aphids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbivory"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prunus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salivary Glands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28547891", "10.1111/1744-7917.12336"]}}]}
