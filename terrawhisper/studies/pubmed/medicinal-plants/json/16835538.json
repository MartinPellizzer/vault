Nurses working with mature women, both in the community and in hospital, may find themselves drawn into a debate about these remedies, yet may feel unable to answer women's questions, or be unsure where to find information. However, with the increased use of complementary therapies generally, it is imperative that nurses recognize the parameters of their personal practice and appreciate the possible problems which may arise from ill-informed use of natural remedies, such as herb-drug interactions. This article provides an overview of herbal remedies popularly self-administered by women in the peri-menopausal period. The effects and safety of several remedies are explored to facilitate nurses to offer accurate, comprehensive and evidence-based information to patients. The issue of integration of herbal medicine into mainstream management of menopausal symptoms is also debated as a means of providing optimum and safe care to women at this time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Expectancy Ltd, London."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tiran", "ForeName": "Denise", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nurs", "NlmUniqueID": "9212059", "ISSNLinking": "0966-0461"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude to Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dissent and Disputes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Needs and Demand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical History Taking"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Menopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nurse's Role"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nursing Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Education as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "nursing", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}], "NumberOfReferences": "44"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16835538", "10.12968/bjon.2006.15.12.21395"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
