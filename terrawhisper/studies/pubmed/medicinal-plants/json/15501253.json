Bioassay-directed fractionation of this extract led to the isolation of two dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans, (8R,8'R)-3'-O-demethyl-5-hydroxymatairesinol (1) and (8R,8'R)-3'-O-demethyl-5-methoxymatairesinol (2), as well as seven known compounds, (-)-5'-methoxyyatein (3), blumenol A, (-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin (anthricin), (-)-deoxypodorhizone, 2,6-dimethoxyhydroquinone, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and beta-sitosterol glucoside. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined using spectroscopic data (1D and 2D NMR, and HREIMS), and the 8R and 8'R absolute stereochemistry was established for both 1 and 2 on the basis of their CD spectra. All isolates obtained in the present study were evaluated for their inhibitory effects with both COX-1 and -2. Of these, only 5'-methoxyyatein (3) showed weak activity against COX-2, while all other compounds isolated were inactive. The COX-2 inhibitory activity of the EtOAc extract was also traced to the presence of several common fatty acids by LC-MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Bao-Ning", "Initials": "BN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "William P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuendet", "ForeName": "Muriel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kardono", "ForeName": "Leonardus B S", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Rachman", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riswan", "ForeName": "Soedarsono", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "Harry H S", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farnsworth", "ForeName": "Norman R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinghorn", "ForeName": "A Douglas", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P01CA48112", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Menispermaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15501253", "10.1016/j.phytochem.2004.08.007", "S0031-9422(04)00381-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
