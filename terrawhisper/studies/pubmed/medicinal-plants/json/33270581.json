An example of such studies in the Iveria-Pharma company is the domestic drug Lazolex (extract of the pericarpium of an unripe walnut), which has passed the necessary preclinical tests and began to be used in the clinic as an antiherpetic agent. On healthy volunteers, we found positive immunotropic effects of Lazolex. Therefore, we considered it necessary to study the antiviral effect of the drug and its immunomodulatory properties in a clinical setting, specifically in chronic herpetic stomatitis. First of all, it was shown that the state of the patients' immune system was in a clear correlation with the severity of the herpes process, i.e. the most severe immunosuppression was recorded in patients with severe stomatitis. The double effect of the drug is to significantly increase the results of antiviral treatment and immunorehabilitation of patients. As a result of a parallel study of Zovirax and Lazolex, a high clinical activity of both drugs was recorded. However, the presence of pronounced immuno-corrective properties in Lazolex manifested itself in an improvement in the quality of patient treatment: active tissue regeneration and a significant decrease in the timing of exacerbation of local herpetic lesions, an increase in the duration of remission. Conducted clinical, laboratory and immunological studies allow us to recommend Lazolex for active use in dental practice for viral diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Department of periodontal and oral mucosa diseases; Georgian-German Implantation Center Hbi-DentImplant; Dental Clinic Davident; V.Bakhutashvili Institute of Medical Biotechnology, Tbilisi; Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University; Georgia."}], "LastName": "Gogotishvili", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Department of periodontal and oral mucosa diseases; Georgian-German Implantation Center Hbi-DentImplant; Dental Clinic Davident; V.Bakhutashvili Institute of Medical Biotechnology, Tbilisi; Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University; Georgia."}], "LastName": "Abashidze", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Department of periodontal and oral mucosa diseases; Georgian-German Implantation Center Hbi-DentImplant; Dental Clinic Davident; V.Bakhutashvili Institute of Medical Biotechnology, Tbilisi; Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University; Georgia."}], "LastName": "Korsantia", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia (Republic)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recurrence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomatitis, Herpetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33270581"]}}]}
