The components of different extracts were defined using the GC-MS method. The effects of G. eriocalyx extracts on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer as well as in vitro antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, and antimicrobial activities were investigated. In accordance with the results obtained, although ethanol and methanol extracts of G. eriocalyx show higher antioxidant activity than G. eriocalyx water extract, enzyme inhibition activities of the extracts were not found to be significant compared to the reference drug. The methanol and ethanol extract of G. eriocalyx exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus. In addition, both extracts significantly inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. The cell growth inhibition by methanol and ethanol extracts induced S phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Lastly, in order to compare the activities of the chemicals found in Gypsophila eriocalyx plant extract, their activities against various proteins that are breast cancer protein (PDB ID:1A52 and 1JNX), antioxidant protein (PDB ID: 1HD2), AChE enzyme protein (PDB ID: 4M0E), BChE enzyme protein (PDB ID: 5NN0), and Escherichia coli protein (PDB ID: 4PRV)were compared. Then, ADME/T analysis calculations were made to examine the effects of molecules with high activity on human metabolism. Eventually, G. eriocalyx is thought to be a potent therapeutic herb that can be considered as an alternative and functional therapy for the management of diseases of a progressive nature related to oxidative damage such as infection, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
