The objective of the present study was to investigate the inter- and intraspecific genetic variation present in 35 individuals of W. somnifera and 5 individuals of W. coagulans using AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) marker technique. The information about genetic variation determined from AFLP data for 40 individuals was employed to estimate similarity matrix value based on Jaccard's coefficient. The similarity values were further used to construct a phenetic dendrogram revealing the genetic relationships. The dendrogram generated by UPGMA (unweighted pair group method of arithmetic averages) distinguished W. somnifera from W. coagulans and formed two major clusters. These two main clusters shared a similarity coefficient of 0.3, correlating with the high level of polymorphism detected. The dendrogram further separated W. somnifera into three subclasses corresponding to Kashmiri and Nagori groups and an intermediate type. The AFLP profile of Kashmiri individuals was distinct from that of the Nagori group of plants. The intermediate genotype was distinct as it shared bands with both the Kashmiri and Nagori individuals, even though it was identified as a Kashmiri morphotype. Furthermore, the intermediate type shared a similarity coefficient of 0.8 with the Kashmiri individuals. The present work revealed low levels of variation within a population though high levels of polymorphism were detected between Nagori and Kashmiri populations. The ability of AFLP markers for efficient and rapid detection of genetic variations at the species as well as intraspecific level qualifies it as an efficient tool for estimating genetic similarity in plant species and effective management of genetic resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioresources and Biotechnology Division, Tata Energy Research Institute, New Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lakshmikumaran", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multigene Family"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11195351", "10.1139/gen-43-6-975"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
