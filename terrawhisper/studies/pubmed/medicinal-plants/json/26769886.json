While much is written on breast milk undersupply, little is written on oversupply, sometimes known as hyperlactation or hypergalactia. Infants of mothers with oversupply may have increased or decreased weight gain. Some may have large, frothy stools. They may develop a disordered latch. Mothers may report overly full, leaking breasts. Thyroid function should be assessed. Treatment is mostly anecdotal and includes methods to maintain breast fullness, such as block feedings. Pseudoephedrine and oral contraceptive pills may decrease the supply. Dopamine agonists such as carbergoline can be used as a last resort."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 by the American Board of Family Medicine."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Conemaugh Family Medicine Residency Program, Johnstown, PA."}], "LastName": "Trimeloni", "ForeName": "Lauren", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Conemaugh Family Medicine Residency Program, Johnstown, PA. jspence@conemaugh.org."}], "LastName": "Spencer", "ForeName": "Jeanne", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Board Fam Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101256526", "ISSNLinking": "1557-2625"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Feeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis, Differential"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Galactorrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperprolactinemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26769886", "10.3122/jabfm.2016.01.150164", "29/1/139"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
