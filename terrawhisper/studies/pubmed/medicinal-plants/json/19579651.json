With that of Bursa, it was one of the greatest trade center for plants, drugs and exotic spices, uncommon and expensive. The products were landed along the southerly water-side of the Golden Horn. The travellers, who discovered with astonishment all the scents of Orient, the aromatic drugs, the mysterious perfumes, were charmed and most of them described particularly and in details this Drugs Bazar of Constantinople in their travelbooks. To day, the merchants of spices (baharat\u00e7i) who are in this place offer to their clients a large choice of aromatic products, homemade specialities and traditional medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre d'histoire du domaine turc, CNRS/EHESS, Etudes turques et ottomanes, UMR 8032, 54 boulevard Raspail, 75006 Paris."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicolas", "ForeName": "Mich\u00e8le", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Le March\u00e9 aux drogues de Constantinople."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Hist Pharm (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "0204315", "ISSNLinking": "0035-2349"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19579651"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
