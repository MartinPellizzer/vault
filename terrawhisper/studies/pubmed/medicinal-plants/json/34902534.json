Perrier) extracts potently inhibit Plasmodium falciparum rings, merozoite egress and invasion.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "114909", "MedlinePgn": "114909"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Terminalia mantaly (H. Perrier) and Terminalia superba (Engl. & Diels) are sources of treatment for various diseases, including malaria and/or related symptoms in parts of Southwestern Cameroon. However, there is limited information on the extent of the antiplasmodial potential of their extracts.", "The present study was designed to investigate the antiplasmodial potential of chromatographic sub fractions (SFs) from promising fractions of Terminalia mantaly (Tm) [Tmsb<sup>w</sup>Chl, the chloroform fraction from water extract of Tm, IC<sub>50</sub> (\u03bcg/mL) PfINDO: 0.56, Pf3D7: 1.12; SI\u00a0>\u00a0357 (HEK/PfINDO) & 178 (HEK/Pf3D7)] and Terminalia superba (Ts) [Tsr<sup>m</sup>EA, the ethyl acetate fraction from methanolic extract of Ts, IC<sub>50</sub> (\u03bcg/mL) PfINDO: 1.82, Pf3D7: 1.65; SI\u00a0>\u00a0109 (HEK/PfINDO) & 121 (HEK/Pf3D7)] obtained from previous studies. The SFs were tested against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (Pf3D7-chloroquine sensitive) and INDO (PfINDO-chloroquine resistant) strains in culture. Also, the phytochemical profile of potent SFs was determined and finally, the inhibition of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum by the SFs with the highest promise was assessed.", "Selected SFs were submitted to a second bio-guided fractionation using silica gel column chromatography. The partial phytochemical composition of potent antiplasmodial SFs was determined using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The SYBR Green I-based fluorescence microtiter plate assay was used to monitor the growth of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in culture in the presence or absence of extracts. Microscopy and flow cytometry counting was used to assess the Plasmodium falciparum stage-specific inhibition and post-drug exposure growth suppression by highly potent extracts.", "Twenty-one of the 39 SFs afforded from Tmsb<sup>w</sup>Chl showed activity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.29-4.74\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) against both Pf3D7 and PfINDO strains. Of note, eight SFs namely, Tm25, Tm28-30, Tm34-36 and Tm38, exerted highly potent antiplasmodial activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) with IC<sub>50</sub>PfINDO: 0.41-0.84\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and IC<sub>50</sub>Pf3D7: 0.29-0.68\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. They also displayed very high selectivity (50\u00a0<\u00a0SI<sub>PfINDO</sub>, SI<sub>Pf3D7</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0344) on the two Plasmodial strains. On the other hand, 7 SFs (SFs Ts03, Ts04, Ts06, Ts09, Ts10, Ts12 and Ts13) from Tsr<sup>m</sup>EA showed promising inhibitory potential against both parasite strains (IC<sub>50</sub>: 2.01-5.14\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Sub fraction Tm36 (IC<sub>50</sub>PfINDO: 0.41\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, SI<sub>PfINDO</sub> > 243; IC<sub>50</sub>Pf3D7: 0.29\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, SI<sub>Pf3D7</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0344) showed the highest promise. The GC-MS analysis of the 8 selected SFs led to the identification of 99 phytometabolites, with D-limonene (2), benzaldehyde (12), carvone (13), caryophyllene (35), hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (74) and 9-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester (82) being the main constituents. Sub fractions Tm28, Tm29, Tm30, Tm36 and Tm38 inhibited all the three intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, with strong potency against ring stage development, merozoite egress and invasion processes.", "This study has identified highly potent antiplasmodial SFs from Terminalia mantaly with significant activity on the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum. These SFs qualify as promising sources of novel antiplasmodial lead compounds. Further purification and characterization studies are expected to unravel molecular targets in rings and merozoites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
