These communities were perhaps some of the original inhabitants of Kerala who have evolved their own peculiar cultural traditions, religious customs, cults, totems, legends, myths, folklores and medicinal practices. But in recent years these communities are being enveloped in the rising tide of civilization and their age old cultural heritage and knowledge systems are fast disappearing. Considering the great importance of conserving/preserving this knowledge system the present study was undertaken. Much interesting information on the cultural life of these communities was gathered. Special attention was paid to the study of their medicinal practices which is essentially a magico-religious-herbal therapy. These tribals have an indepth knowledge of the surrounding flora and utilize over 500 plant species for treating various ailments. The present communication reports only those medical claims for plants that have not been previously published."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pushpangadan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atal", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3747563", "10.1016/0378-8741(86)90088-7", "0378-8741(86)90088-7"]}}]}
