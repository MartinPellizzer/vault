Luteolin was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPCL). Signs of toxicity of mice in PFE and luteolin were monitored for LD50 calculation. The behavioral symptoms of THC withdrawal (stereotypies, ambulation, and inactivity time) induced by the rimonabant challenge were illustrated in THC-dependent mice receiving PFE, luteolin, and melatonin. The expression of mature BDNF (mBDNF) was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The dopamine concentrations were measured using HPLC. PFE and luteolin LD50 were 650 and 220 mg/kg, respectively. PFE (300 mg/kg), all doses of luteolin, and melatonin increased significantly the mBDNF expression and decreased the dopamine concentration. The findings suggest that PFE, luteolin, and melatonin are mighty in reducing the signs of THC withdrawal. It seems these effects were due to a decrease in dopamine concentration level and an increase in mBDNF protein expression in mice brains."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemian-Yadegari", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Adineh", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Hamidreza", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Davari", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Psychosocial Injuries, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Veisani", "ForeName": "Yousef", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaneialvar", "ForeName": "Hori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aidy", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0482-1554"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Elahe", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Lorestan University of Medical Sciences and Ilam University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cell Biochem Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "8305874", "ISSNLinking": "0263-6484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JL5DK93RCL", "NameOfSubstance": "Melatonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prosopis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Melatonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kesner AJ, Lovinger DM.
