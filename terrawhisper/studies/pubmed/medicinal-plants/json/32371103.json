Because nobiletin and tangeretin have attracted attention due to their beneficial health properties, citrus peel extracts, in which they are concentrated, have the potential to serve as a functional food ingredient to prevent diseases. In this study, a series of toxicological studies on the peel extract of Ponkan cultivar 'Ohta ponkan' (Citrus reticulata Blanco), was conducted. No mutagenic activity was observed in a bacterial reverse mutation test, whereas chromosomal aberrations were induced in an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test. No genotoxicity was observed in an in vivo mammalian micronucleus test. In a 90-day study at daily doses of 54, 180, or 540\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, hyaline droplet nephropathy, which specifically occurs in adult male rats, was observed in males of 540\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day group. No other adverse effects were observed in the 90-day study. The no adverse effect level in the 90-day study was considered to be 540\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day for female rats and less than 540\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day for male rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
