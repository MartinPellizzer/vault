A survey of 492 members of support groups and health-care clinics in Kasese district, Uganda was undertaken in a group setting: 23 groups with a mean size of 21, age range 4-53, which represented 0.1% of the population, covering nine of the 20 sub-counties, both in the native languages and in English, using photographs and specimens of 12 plants. Most admitted to using plants at some time-81% for self, 77% for their children; 45% admitted to using traditional healers as a source for information about health. Most plants were home grown or available locally. Medicinal plants were used for respiratory infections, fever, malaria and diarrhoea/vomiting. HIV/AIDS was rarely treated with medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St Paul's Health Centre, South Rwenzori Diocese, PO Box 142, Kasese, Uganda. simon.sharon@gmx.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Challand", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Trop Doct", "NlmUniqueID": "1301706", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4755"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uganda"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16354476", "10.1258/004947505774938512"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
