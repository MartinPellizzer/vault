Here, we have shown that the ability to target specific cellular and molecular components of psoriasis pathogenesis with nanoscale precision using phos-phodiesterase 4 inhibitors represents a transformative opportunity to address the complex nature of this dermatological condition.", "In this review, we have examined the molecular mechanisms behind the pathogenic features of psoriasis and new treatments being tested in clinical settings. There is research being done on new treatments created in the last ten years. This field highlights the advantages of nan-otechnological technologies as cutting-edge candidates for drug delivery systems in psoriasis and other inflammatory chronic skin disorders. Future Developments: Nanotechnology-based treatments currently under study show good effi-cacy and low side effect profiles. However, long-term prospective trials are required to demon-strate long-term safety and effectiveness. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of vitamin D3 derivatives and corticoster-oids, and coal tar formulations are some of the newer topical treatments for psoriasis.", "The psoriasis treatment continues to involve conventional medications (i.e., medi-cines that are generally acknowledged as either normal therapy or outdated remedies), whether used topically or orally. Nonetheless, we are starting to see initiatives to create pharmaceuticals and biosimilars with better therapeutic results, fewer side effects, and greater efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0007-8656-1720"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teerthanker Mahaveer College of Pharmacy, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad (UP), 244001, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9183-0875"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teerthanker Mahaveer College of Pharmacy, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad (UP), 244001, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Prashant", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1122-3405"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Scholar, Teerthanker Mahaveer College of Pharmacy, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad (UP), 244001, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Himanshu", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39075964", "10.2174/0118715265298802240603120251", "IDDT-EPUB-141863"]}}]}
