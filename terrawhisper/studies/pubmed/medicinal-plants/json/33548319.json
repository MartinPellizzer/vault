It was purified by one-step affinity chromatography and showed the specific activity of 393\u00a0U/mg with 81.9-fold purification. The molecular weight of PaL was estimated to be approximately 60\u00a0kDa using gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE. Moreover, it depicted diphenolase activity and high affinity towards 2,6-dimethoxy phenol (K<sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a010.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mM) and syringaldazine (K<sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a06.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mM) comparing with plant-origin polyphenol oxidases reported in the literature. It should be noted that PaL possessed optimal activity at pH\u00a07.5 and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. It also remained stable under different conditions of pH (6.5-8.0), temperature (25-45\u00a0\u00b0C), and when it was exposed to several metal ions. The MTT and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that the enzyme treatment significantly affected growth of HeLa, HepG2, and MDA-MB-231 cells with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31, and 26.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u03bcM after 72\u00a0h, respectively. NOVELTY STATEMENT: This is the first attempt to isolate and characterize a new oxidoreductase from the resin of Pistacia atlantica Desf., native species of Iran, to recruit it in cytotoxicity researches. In the purification process by an efficient affinity column (SBA-NH<sub>2</sub>-GA), the enzyme was eluted promptly with a satisfied yield. The purified laccase exerted higher affinity to diphenolic compounds and pH-thermal stability compared to other plant-derived polyphenol oxidases. The purified enzyme was found to show anti-oxidant capacity and significantly inhibited the growth of cancerous cells in vitro. PaL showed more cytotoxic activity towards HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells by induction of apoptosis. The cytotoxic activity of the laccase was measured by flow cytometry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
