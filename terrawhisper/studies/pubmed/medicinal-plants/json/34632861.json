Appropriate analytical techniques together with multivariate statistics analysis are required for the quality control and evaluation of these edible mushrooms. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and infrared (IR) technologies have the advantages of time-saving, low-cost, and environmentally friendly, are now prominent among major analytical technologies for quality evaluation of bolete mushrooms. Chemometrics methods have been developed to solve classification and regression issues of bolete mushrooms in combination with spectrum. This paper reviewed the most recent applications of UV-Vis and IR technology coupled with chemometrics in wild edible bolete mushrooms, including the identification of species, origin, and storage duration, fraud detection, and antioxidant properties evaluation, and discussed the limitations and prospects of spectroscopy technologies in the researches of bolete mushrooms, excepting to provide a reference for further research and practical application of wild edible bolete mushrooms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie-Qing", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhaotong University, Zhaotong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hong-Gao", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhong", "Initials": "YZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34632861", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1984870", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1984870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
