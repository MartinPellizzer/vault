Then different mathematic models were used to estimate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The response surface methodology was used to optimize the process of extraction and the prediction was carried out through comparing the observed and predicted values.", "The regression coefficient of binomial fitting complex model was 0.9515, and the optimum conditions of extraction process were 12-fold volume of solvent, 1.5 hours for decoction and 2 times for extraction.
