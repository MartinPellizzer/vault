The industrial relevance of these plants is based on the occurence of specialized metabolites that exhibit a range of pharmaceutical potential. Besides that, several species are relevant due to their ornamental value. Taking to account the vast market worth of products and processes involving Hypericum, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of patents concerning this subject between 2007and 2017. For this purpose, a survey was performed in free databases (Espacenet\u00ae, PatentScope\u00ae and Google Patents\u00ae) using the keyword Hypericum in the patents title or title plus abstract. The documents were then organized by groups (medicinal and non-medicinal approaches), subgroups, type of applicants and countries. Espacenet\u00ae was chosen to data analysis, and a total of 174 patents were found. The majority of the applicants are from China and companies appear as the principal owners of patents. Several technologies are not intended for medicinal purposes, being mainly related to the development of new cultivars for ornamental uses. Concerning the medicinal approaches, the chief subject is related to extraction and incorporation into formulations. The main species cited in the documents is H. perforatum and the therapeutic use is for central nervous system diseases. In general, this study covers the patents published in recent years hoping to boost the scientists and companies that invest in Hypericum researches to visualize the state of art, opportunities and challenges for innovation in this area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
