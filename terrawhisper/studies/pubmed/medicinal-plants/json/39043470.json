Zone of Inhibition determination by Agar well diffusion assay was used to assess antimicrobial activity.", "The Baccaurea ramiflora and Microcos paniculata leaves extracted with different solvents such as petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol and water among that in leaves ethanolic extract produce 10.78, 10.38 percentage yield respectively. Both the extracts subjected for phytochemical investigation revealed the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, saponins, proteins and flavonoids. Ethanolic extract of Baccaurea ramiflora showed maximum inhibition zone diameter was obtained in Salmonella typhi (Gram-negative bacteria) with diameter 29 mm and 25 mm respectively at 200mg/ml and 100mg/ml. Similarly, Ethanolic extract of Microcos paniculata showed minimum inhibition zone diameter compare to Baccaurea ramiflora was obtained in Salmonella typhi (Gram-negative bacteria) with diameter 23 mm and 19 mm respectively at 200mg/ml and 100mg/ml. Ethanolic extract of Baccaurea ramiflora showed maximum inhibition zone diameter was obtained in Aspergillus fumigates with diameter 25 mm and 22 mm respectively at 200mg/ml and 100mg/ml. Similarly, Ethanolic extract of Microcos paniculata showed minimum inhibition zone diameter compare to Baccaurea ramiflora was obtained in Aspergillus fumigates with diameter 21 mm and 19 mm respectively at 200mg/ml and 100mg/ml.", "The current findings point to Baccaurea ramiflora and Microcos paniculata antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.
