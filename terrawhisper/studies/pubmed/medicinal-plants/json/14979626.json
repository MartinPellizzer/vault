This raises concerns regarding their use instead of proven therapies, their side effects, and drug interaction potential.", "The study sought to characterize cardiology patients who used supplements and to examine whether their use was diagnosis or doctor dependent, whether it affected patients' compliance, and what supplements were used.", "In all, 187 patients attending our cardiology clinic were interviewed, examined, and followed for up to 1 year. The users and nonusers of naturoceuticals were compared.", "Supplements were used in 106 patients (an average of 3.1 naturoceutical per patient). There were no significant differences in their use by gender, age, primary care doctor specialty, or cardiovascular medications prescribed (except for statins). Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of coronary artery disease were more likely to use the supplements. Average low-density lipoprotein (106 vs. 108 mg/dl), average blood pressure (132/77 vs. 138/78 mmHg), and average hemoglobin (Hb)A1c (8.7 vs. 7.7%) showed no statistically significant differences between users and nonusers. Patients most commonly took multivitamins, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin B, folate, garlic, calcium, coenzyme Q10, and gingko.", "This study indicates that naturoceutical use is widespread among cardiovascular patients and it is difficult to predict clinically who the users are. Fortunately, according to our limited compliance measures, it appears that the naturoceutical use has not affected patients' compliance with traditional medications. Also, possibly a detrimental interaction potential between traditional medications and naturoceuticals has been demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York 11790, USA. tstys@aol.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stys", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stys", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawson", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903272", "ISSNLinking": "0160-9289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Naturopathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Ettner SL, Appel S, Wilkey S, Van Rompay M, Kessler RC: Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990\u20131997: Results of a follow\u2010up national survey.
