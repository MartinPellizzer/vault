DPHD given by i.p., p.o., i.t., or i.c.v. elicited significant and dose-related antinociception. At the ID50 level, DPHD was about 2- to 39-fold more potent than aspirin and dipyrone, but it was about 14- to 119-fold less potent than morphine. Its analgesic action was reversed by treatment of animals with p-chlorophenylalanine, naloxone, cyprodime, naltrindole, nor-binaltrorphimine, L-arginine, or pertussis toxin. Its action was also modulated by adrenal-gland hormones but was not affected by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A or type B antagonist, bicuculine, or phaclofen, nor was it affected by glibenclamide. DPHD, given daily for up to 7 days, did not develop tolerance to itself nor did it induce cross-tolerance to morphine. However, animals rendered tolerant to morphine presented cross-tolerance to DPHD. The antinociception of DPHD was not secondary to its anti-inflammatory effect, nor was it associated with nonspecific effects such as muscle relaxation or sedation. DPHD, in contrast to morphine, did not decrease charcoal meal transit in mice, nor did it inhibit electrical field stimulation of the guinea pig ileum or mouse vas deferens in vitro. Thus, DPHD produces dose-dependent and pronounced systemic, spinal, and supraspinal antinociception in mice, including against the neurogenic nociception induced by formalin and capsaicin. Its antinociceptive effect involves multiple mechanisms of action, namely interaction with mu, delta, or kappa opioid systems, L-arginine-nitric oxide and serotonin pathways, activation of Gi protein sensitive to pertussis toxin, and modulation by endogenous glucocorticoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Center of Biological Science, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, 88049-900, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miguel", "ForeName": "O G", "Initials": "OG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "8,10-di-N-propyllobelidiol hydrochloride dihydrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Abdominal Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Transit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Postural Balance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vas Deferens"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10087033"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
