The gross structures and the relative configurations of the new compounds were deduced by spectroscopic data analysis. The absolute configurations were defined by comparison of their experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra data. All compounds were screened for their neuroprotective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced SH-SY5Y cells injury. Compounds 2, 3, 7, 8 and 13 exhibited comparable neuroprotective activity to the positive trolox at 50\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
