The present study concerns the effect of different extracts of L. album on ZNF703 gene expression and apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma AGS cells. Method and material: Hydro alchoholic L. album extracts from various plant sources were produced by Maceration. AGS cells were treated with different concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 \u03bcg/ml) and the cytotoxicity potency was assessed after 24 h by MTT assay. Then, quantitative real time PCR was conducted for ZNF703 gene expression in AGS cells. Also, cell apoptosis/necrosis was assessed with the aid of Annexin V/PI staining and quantification by flow cytometry. Results: L. album extracts exerted dose-dependent toxicity in the AGS cell line. The mRNA levels of ZNF703 gene expression were significantly decreased with rhizome, fruit at fruiting, leaf and stem at anthesis (P<0.001), and leaf and stem at fruiting extracts as compared to the controls (P<0.01). Also, the number of apoptotic cells was increased from 2.70% (statistically significant; p<0.05) in untreated AGS cells to 44%, following treatment with the leaf and stem at anthesis example. Discussion: Our findings revealed that the L. album extracts can induce apoptosis and might modulate cytotoxicity by down regulating ZNF703 gene expression in AGS cells. Therefore, this extract could be a good candidate for inhibiting cancer cell growth, especially that of gastric cancer. In addition, ZNF703 may have potential as a therapeutic target."], "CopyrightInformation": "Creative Commons Attribution License"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.
