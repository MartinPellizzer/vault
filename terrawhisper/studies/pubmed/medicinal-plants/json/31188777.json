The effects of hydroalcoholic extract of the plant seeds and metformin against the diabetes-induced memory impairment were investigated. Materials and methods The rats were treated: (1) control, (2) diabetic (3-6) and diabetic rats treated by 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of the plant extract or metformin. The rats were diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg). After the passive avoidance test, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, total thiol (SH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined in the brain. Results In the diabetic group, at 3, 24 and 48 h after receiving a shock, the latency to enter the dark room was lower than for the controls (p < 0.001). All doses of the extract and metformin increased the latencies to enter the dark at 3 and 24 h after the shock treatment (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Additionally, the two higher doses of the extract and metformin increased the latency at 48 h after the shock (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Diabetes also elevated MDA and NO metabolites, while it reduced thiol, SOD and CAT in the hippocampal and cortical tissues (p < 0.001). Treatment of the diabetic animals by the highest dose of the extract and also metformin reduced the MDA and NO metabolites, while it improved thiols, SOD and CAT (p < 0.01-p < 0.001). Conclusions Based on our findings, metformin and the hydro-alcoholic extract from the T. foenum-graceum seed prevented memory deficits resulting from diabetes. Preventing oxidative damage in the brain may at least, in part, be responsible for the positive effects of the extract and metformin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bafadam", "ForeName": "Solaiman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodabakhshi", "ForeName": "Tayebeh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asghari", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi", "ForeName": "Babak", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0466-1311"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudabady", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Niazmand", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, Phone: +98-51-38828565, Fax: +98-51-38828564."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig", "NlmUniqueID": "101538885", "ISSNLinking": "1868-1883"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31188777", "10.1515/hmbci-2018-0074", "/j/hmbci.ahead-of-print/hmbci-2018-0074/hmbci-2018-0074.xml"]}}]}
