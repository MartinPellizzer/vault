Our previous work indicated a strong association between imidacloprid resistance and the overexpression of a cytochrome P450 gene CYP6AY3v2 in a L.\u00a0striatellus imidacloprid resistant strain (Imid-R). In this study, a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line that overexpressed the L.\u00a0striatellus CYP6AY3v2 gene was established and was found to confer increased levels of imidacloprid resistance. Furthermore, CYP6AY3v2 was co-expressed with D.\u00a0melanogaster cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (SF9) cells. A carbon monoxide difference spectra analysis indicated that CYP6AY3v2 was expressed predominately in its cytochrome P450 (P450) form, which is indicative of a good-quality functional enzyme. The recombinant CYP6AY3v2 protein efficiently catalysed the model substrate P-nitroanisole to p-nitrophenol with a maximum velocity (V<sub>max</sub> ) of 60.78\u2009\u00b1\u20093.93 optical density (mOD)/min/mg protein. In addition, imidacloprid itself was metabolized by the recombinant CYP6AY3v2/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt (NADPH) CPR microsomes in in vitro assays (catalytic constant (K<sub>cat</sub> )\u2009=\u20090.34 pmol/min/pmol P450, michaelis constant (K<sub>m</sub> )\u2009=\u200941.98 \u03bcM), and imidacloprid depletion and metabolite peak formation were with a time dependence. The data provided direct evidence that CYP6AY3v2 is capable of hydroxylation of imidacloprid and conferring metabolic resistance in L.\u00a0striatellus."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The
