Three blood samples were collected on the first day of the study and similarly on the 2nd and 7th days after garlic administration, either in raw or fried form. Fibrinolytic activity increased by 72% and 63% within 6 h of administration of raw or fried garlic, respectively. The elevated levels were maintained up to 12 h. In the second part of the study, raw or fried garlic was administered for 4 weeks to patients with ischaemic heart disease and fibrinolytic activity was measured at weekly intervals. It showed a sustained increase, rising to 84.8% at the end of 28th day when raw garlic was administered. Similarly, with fried garlic the rise was 72%. The study shows that: (i) both raw and fried garlic significantly enhance fibrinolytic activity (FA); (ii) garlic enhances FA within hours of administration; (iii) FA continues to rise with continued administration of garlic; (iv) frying removes the strong acrid smell of garlic, but preserves its useful effect on FA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chutani", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bordia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Atherosclerosis", "NlmUniqueID": "0242543", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9150"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7225179", "10.1016/0021-9150(81)90058-7", "0021-9150(81)90058-7"]}}]}
