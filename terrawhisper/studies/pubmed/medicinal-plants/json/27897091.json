DC with high L-DOPA (L-3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine) yields, with non-itching characteristics and better adaptability by applying \u03b3-irradiation. Molecular and chemical analysis was performed for screening based on specific characteristics desired for developing suitable genotypes.", "Developed, mutant populations were analyzed for L-DOPA % in seeds through TLC (thin layer chromatography), and the results obtained were validated with the HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography). The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) was isolated from the leaf at the initial stage and used for DNA polymorphism. RNA (Ribonucleic acid) was isolated from the leaf during maturity and used for expression analysis.", "The selected mutant T-I-7 showed 5.7% L-DOPA content compared to 3.18% of parent CIM-Ajar. The total polymorphism obtained was 57% with the molecular marker analysis. The gene expression analysis showed higher fold change expression of the dopadecarboxylase gene (DDC) in control compared to selected mutants (T-I-7, T-II-23, T-IV-9, T-VI-1).", "DNA polymorphism was used for the screening of mutants for efficient screening at an early stage. TLC was found suitable for the large-scale comparative chemical analysis of L-DOPA. The expression profile of DDC clearly demonstrated the higher yields of L-DOPA in selected mutants developed by \u03b3-irradiation in the seeds of the control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Susheel Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Deepti", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "Raj Kishori", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Madan M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Dhawan", "ForeName": "Sunita Singh", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Radiat Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8809243", "ISSNLinking": "0955-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "46627O600J", "NameOfSubstance": "Levodopa"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Enhancement"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Levodopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mucuna"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27897091", "10.1080/09553002.2016.1254832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
