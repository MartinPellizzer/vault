Animal waste serves as a primary source of organic fertilizer for intensive large-scale agricultural cultivation, including the widely utilized medicinal and edible plant, Polygonatum cyrtonem. In this study, we employed a novel plant stress tissue culture technology to investigate the toxic effects of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) on P. cyrtonema. TCH and SDZ exhibited varying degrees of influence on plant growth, photosynthesis, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system. Flavonoid levels increased following exposure to TCH and SDZ. The biosynthesis and signaling pathways of the growth hormones auxin and gibberellic acid were suppressed by both antibiotics, while the salicylic acid-mediated plant stress response was specifically induced in the case of SDZ. Overall, the study unveiled both common and unique responses at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels in P. cyrtonema following exposure to two distinct types of antibiotics, providing a foundational framework for comprehensively elucidating the precise toxic effects of antibiotics and the versatile adaptive mechanisms in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
