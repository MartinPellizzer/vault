Patients treated with garlic consistently showed a greater decrease in total cholesterol levels compared with those receiving placebo. Meta-analysis of homogeneous trials estimated a net cholesterol decrease attributable to garlic of 0.59 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.74) (23 mg/dL [CI, 17 to 29]) (P < 0.001).", "Meta-analysis of the controlled trials of garlic to reduce hypercholesterolemia showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels.
