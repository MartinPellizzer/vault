Olfactory indicators in plants include volatile compounds, principally represented by the terpenoid fraction. Currently, medicinal- and adult-use cannabis is marketed in the United States with relatively little differentiation between products other than by a common name, association with a species type, and \u0394-9 tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol potency. Because of this practice, how terpenoid compositions may change during an extraction process is widely overlooked. Here we report on a comparative study of terpenoid and cannabinoid potencies of flower and supercritical fluid CO<sub>2</sub> (SC-CO<sub>2</sub>) extract from six cannabis chemovars grown in Washington State. To enable this comparison, we employed a validated high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector methodology for quantification of seven cannabinoids and developed an internal gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for quantification of 42 terpenes. The relative potencies of terpenoids and cannabinoids in flower versus concentrate were significantly different. Cannabinoid potency increased by factors of 3.2 for \u0394-9 tetrahydrocannabinol and 4.0 for cannabidiol in concentrates compared to flower. Monoterpenes were lost in the extraction process; a ketone increased by 2.2; an ether by 2.7; monoterpene alcohols by 5.3, 7 and 9.4; and sesquiterpenes by 5.1, 4.2, 7.7, and 8.9. Our results demonstrate that the product of SC-CO<sub>2</sub> extraction may have a significantly different chemotypic fingerprint from that of cannabis flower. These results highlight the need for more complete characterization of cannabis and associated products, beyond cannabinoid content, in order to further understand health-related consequences of inhaling or ingesting concentrated forms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytalytics LLC, Kirkland, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Sexton", "ForeName": "Michelle", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytalytics LLC, Kirkland, WA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicine Creek Analytics, Fife, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Shelton", "ForeName": "Kyle", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CO\u2082 Garden Extracts, Redmond, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Haley", "ForeName": "Pam", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Lion Farms, Seattle, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "West", "ForeName": "Mike", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Planta Med. 2018 Mar;84(4):E3. doi: 10.1055/s-0043-122272", "PMID": "29165726"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest to divulge."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28926863", "10.1055/s-0043-119361"]}}]}
