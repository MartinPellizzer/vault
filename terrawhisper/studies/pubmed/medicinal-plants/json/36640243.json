Presently, there are 16 varieties of Perilla frutescens in the variety registration system of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishes in Japan (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Variety registration data search. http://www.hinshu2.maff.go.jp/ . Accessed 03 Nov 2022). One such variety is \"Shimoadachi,\" which contains citral as a main essential oil component and has a lemon-like smell. To our knowledge, no other cultivars with similar characteristics in P. frutescens have been identified. Additionally, the registered variety \"per-001\" contains high contents of perillaldehyde and rosmarinic acid, with practical applications for herbal medicines and functional foods. Therefore, the development of variety identification techniques is necessary for stable production and protection. In this study, we investigated microsatellite loci for the accurate identification of registered varieties of red perilla. These loci provide a basis for breeding superior varieties of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
