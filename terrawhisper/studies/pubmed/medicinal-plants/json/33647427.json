The species is rich repository of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites together with secoiridoidal glycosides.", "The study aimed to investigate the chemical diversity in different populations/cytotypes prevailing in G. kurroo to identify elite genetic stocks in terms of optimum accumulation/biosynthesis of desired metabolites and having higher in-vitro cytotoxicity potential in relation to chemotypic diversity.", "The wild plants of the species were collected from different ranges of altitudes from the Kashmir Himalayas. For cytological evaluation, the standard meiotic analysis was performed. The standard LC-MS/MS technique was employed for phytochemical analysis based on different marker compounds viz. sweroside, swertiamarin, and gentiopicroside. Different tissues such as root-stock, aerial parts, and flowers were used for chemo-profiling. Further, the methanolic extracts of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes were assessed for cytotoxic activity by using MTT assay against four different human cancer cell lines.", "The quantification of major bioactive compounds based on tissue- and location-specific comparison, as well as in-vitro cytotoxic potential among extant cytotypes, was evaluated. The comprehensive cytomorphological studies of the populations from NW Himalayas revealed the occurrence of different chromosomal races viz. n\u00a0=\u00a013, 26. The tetraploid cytotype was hitherto unreported. The tissue-specific chemo-profiling revealed relative dominance of different phytoconstituents in root-stock. There was a noticeable increase in the quantity of the analyzed compounds in relation to increasing ploidy status along the increasing altitudes. The MTT assay of methanolic extracts of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes displayed significant cytotoxicity potential in tetraploids. The root-stock extracts of tetraploids were highly active extracts with IC<sub>50</sub> value ranges from 5.65 to 8.53\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against HCT-116 colon cancer.", "The chemical evaluation of major bioactive compounds in diverse cytotypes from different plant parts along different altitudes presented an appreciable variability in sweroside, swertiamarin, and gentiopicroside contents. Additionally, the concentrations of these phytoconstituents varied for cytotoxicity potential among different screened cytotypes. This quantitative difference of active bio-constituents was in correspondence with the growth inhibition percentage of different tested cancer cell lines. Thus, the present investigation strongly alludes towards a prognostic approach for the identification of elite cytotypes/chemotypes with significant pharmacological potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
