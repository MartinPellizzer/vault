In addition, VIGS approach has been successfully used to provide insights into the role of several genes and regulators involved in plant secondary metabolism. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an important Indian medicinal plant that accumulates pharmacologically important triterpenoid steroidal lactones, which are collectively termed as withanolides. W. somnifera being a highly recalcitrant plant for genetic transformation, Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated VIGS was established by our group to facilitate understanding of withanolides' pathway. Here, we describe a detailed procedure to carry out VIGS for gene function studies in W. somnifera."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Bomzan", "ForeName": "Dikki Pedenla", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Shilpashree", "ForeName": "H B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Anjali", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sarma Rajeev", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India. da.nagegowda@cimap.res.in."}], "LastName": "Nagegowda", "ForeName": "Dinesh A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Methods Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214969", "ISSNLinking": "1064-3745"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Withanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V038D626IF", "NameOfSubstance": "Ashwagandha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Withanolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32557367", "10.1007/978-1-0716-0751-0_11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
