Body weight, food intake, leptin, blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, and pro- and anti-in\ufb02ammatory genes expression were assessed on day 106.", "The HGFD control mice displayed markedly elevated adipose tissue inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin inactivity, and hyperglycemia. Administration of LCE in the HGFD mice, especially a dose of 100\u202fmg/kg, lowered the body weight, food intake, plasma leptin, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, insulin resistance, and increased the food efficacy ratio when compared with the HGFD control mice. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed that LCE prevented further increase in the circulating levels after the glucose load. LCE-treated mice demonstrated a marked suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression. On the other hand, the mice showed a higher anti-in\ufb02ammatory genes mRNA expression in the adipose tissue. In addition, LCE treatment improved the oxidative damage as evidenced by the reduced levels of lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances coupled with the increased antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, total glutathione, glutathione/glutathione disul\ufb01de ratio and glutathione peroxidase) in the adipose tissue, plasma and erythrocytes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the bioactive compounds revealed the presence of 9, 12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid, vitamin E, phytol, hexadecanoic acid, benzenepropanoic acid, and stigmasterol.", "These findings prove that LCE improves the insulin-sensitizing activity in the mouse model of HGFD-caused IR, probably due to the amelioration of adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative damage. Hence, the LCE could serve as a useful anti-diabetic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
