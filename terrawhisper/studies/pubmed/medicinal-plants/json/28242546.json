In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 37.96\u00b10.36 to 48.7\u00b10.21\u03bcg/mL) against breast, liver, colon and skin cancer cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02\u03bcM). Hexane and ethyl acetate fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000\u03bcg/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500\u03bcg/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27\u00b10.06 to 46.12\u00b10.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05\u00b10.24 to 14.46\u00b10.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35\u00b10.85 to 62.52\u00b10.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56\u00b10.38 to 64.85\u00b11.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
