Iljinskaja. Selecting elite individuals with high triterpenoids content is the basis of C. paliurus industry for medicinal use. In this study, seasonal variation patterns of total triterpenoids and five triterpene monomers accumulation for three groups with different total triterpenoid contents (TTC; H: 59.74-64.03\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>; M: 47.66-57.08\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, and L: 35.26-42.22\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>) were surveyed. Seasonal expression dynamics of 6 key genes relevant to triterpenoids biosynthesis, including HMGR, DXR, SQS, SE, LUS, and \u03b2-AS, were described by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for three groups. The expression levels of HMGR, SE, LUS, and \u03b2-AS genes in group H were higher than in groups M and L. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that they were significantly positively correlated with triterpene accumulation, and the expression level of SE gene not only was significantly correlated with downstream genes, but also exhibited a linear relationship with TTC, especially in September. These results suggest that SE gene could serve as an effective make for screening elite individuals with high TTC from the germplasm of C. paliurus for medicinal use. Further testing on randomly selected individuals in next September proved the feasibility and reliability of SE gene in assisted selection. Also, we successfully cloned the full-length cDNA of SE. Thus, our work provides an efficient way to attain superior genotypes to develop medicinal industry of C. paliurus in practice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
