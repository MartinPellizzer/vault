Peppermint tea, brewed from the plant leaves, and the essential oil of peppermint are used in traditional medicines. Evidence-based research regarding the bioactivity of this herb is reviewed. The phenolic constituents of the leaves include rosmarinic acid and several flavonoids, primarily eriocitrin, luteolin and hesperidin. The main volatile components of the essential oil are menthol and menthone. In vitro, peppermint has significant antimicrobial and antiviral activities, strong antioxidant and antitumor actions, and some antiallergenic potential. Animal model studies demonstrate a relaxation effect on gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, analgesic and anesthetic effects in the central and peripheral nervous system, immunomodulating actions and chemopreventive potential. Human studies on the GI, respiratory tract and analgesic effects of peppermint oil and its constituents have been reported. Several clinical trials examining the effects of peppermint oil on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms have been conducted. However, human studies of peppermint leaf are limited and clinical trials of peppermint tea are absent. Adverse reactions to peppermint tea have not been reported, although caution has been urged for peppermint oil therapy in patients with GI reflux, hiatal hernia or kidney stones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, 711 Washington St., Boston, MA 02111, USA. diane.mckay@tufts.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKay", "ForeName": "Diane L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blumberg", "ForeName": "Jeffrey B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AV092KU4JH", "NameOfSubstance": "peppermint oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "195"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16767798", "10.1002/ptr.1936"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
