Herein, we show in a mouse model of erythroleukemia that UM171 strongly suppresses leukemia progression. UM171 inhibits cell cycle progression and apoptosis of leukemic cells in culture. The effect of UM171 on leukemia differentiation was accompanied by increased expression of HSCE markers. RNAseq analysis combined with Q-RT-PCR and western blotting revealed that the PIM1 protein kinase is highly elevated in response to UM171 treatment. Moreover, docking analysis combined with immunoprecipitation assays revealed high binding affinity of UM171 to PIM1. Interestingly, pan-PIM kinase inhibitors counteracted the effect of UM171 on HSCE marker expression and PIM1 transcription, but not its suppression of leukemic cell growth. Moreover, combination treatment with UM171 and a pan-PIM inhibitor further suppressed leukemic cell proliferation compared to each drug alone. To uncover the mechanism of growth inhibition, we showed strong upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21<sup>CIP1</sup> and the transcription factor KLF2 by UM171. In accordance, KLF2 knockdown attenuated growth inhibition by UM171. KLF2 upregulation by UM171 is also responsible for the activation of P21<sup>CIP1</sup> in leukemic cells leading to a G1/S arrest and suppression of leukemogenesis. Thus, suppression of leukemic growth by UM171 through KLF2 and P21<sup>CIP1</sup> is thwarted by PIM-mediated expansion of leukemic stemness, uncovering a novel therapeutic modality involving combined UM171 plus PIM inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
