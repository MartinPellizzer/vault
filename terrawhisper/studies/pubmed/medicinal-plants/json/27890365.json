To examine the immunomodulatory effects of Ziziphora and its fractions on macrophage cells, the non-toxic concentration of extract and different fractions determined by MTT assay, and the Griess reaction was used to measure the level of nitrite as an indicator of nitric oxide by the macrophage cells in 10, 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.", "In this study, the Z.\u00a0tenuior extract at 10\u00a0mg/mL concentration was able to kill all protoscolices during 20\u00a0min. By increasing the concentration to 25\u00a0mg/mL, the scolicidal time reduced to 10\u00a0min. Regarding the effect of different fractions of Z.\u00a0tenuior, the ethanolic fraction showed the highest scolicidal activity. The extract demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the activity of macrophages and reduced nitric oxide production. Although the petroleum ether and ethanolic fractions of the extract reduced nitric oxide production, nevertheless, this effect was only significant at 10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL concentrations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "The Z.\u00a0tenuior extract and its fractions were effective against protoscolices yet the effect of total extract was considerable. Our findings indicates that the extract and its ethanolic and petroleum ether fractions could have anti-inflammatory properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Hainan Medical University.
