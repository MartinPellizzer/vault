The treatment/prevention of ALys is not known yet. Therefore, searching for therapeutic agents for amyloidosis is of great value. In this study, we have examined the ability of the aqueous extract of herbalome (thirty herbal components) of Chandraprabha vati (EHCV), a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, to prevent fibrillation of lysozyme. Transmission electron microscopy and multiple biophysical techniques were used to examine the processes. We found complete inhibition of the fibrillation by EHCV, whereas none of the thirty ingredients of EHCV was able to prevent the reaction, solely. We also found the EHCV induced and stabilized secondary structures of aggregation-prone state (APS) of lysozyme. Moreover, an increase in the secondary structure and stability of APS were found to correlate with the inhibition reaction. We conclude that EHCV modulates the structure and stability of APS and converts it into an aggregation resistant state (ARS). We hypothesized that herbal components of Ayurvedic formulation may provide a combination of molecules, which could efficiently prevent aggregation reaction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
