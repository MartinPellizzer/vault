These impurities have raised concerns due to their potential carcinogenic effects. Recent studies have identified nitrosamines as impurities in a number of pharmaceutical products including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The presence of nitrosamines in these products has led to recalls and market withdrawals. In addition to pharmaceuticals, nitrosamines have also been found in some herbal medicines particularly those containing traditional Chinese medicinal ingredients. The presence of nitrosamines in herbal formulations poses a significant risk to public health and highlights the need for quality control and regulations in the herbal drug industry. The present review article aims to discuss nitrosamine impurities (NMI) prominent causes, risks and scientific strategies for preventing NMI in herbal formulations. The primary objective of this study is to examine the origins of nitrosamine contamination in herbal formulations, the risks associated with these contaminants, and the methods for reducing them. The significance of thorough testing and examination before releasing herbal products to the public is also emphasized. In conclusion, the presence of nitrosamines is not limited to pharmaceutical products and poses a significant threat to the safety of herbal drugs as well. Adequate testing and extensive research are crucial for producing and distributing herbal medicines to the general population."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
