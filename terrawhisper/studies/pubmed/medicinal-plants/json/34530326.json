However, only a few studies have investigated the salt-tolerant mechanism of this non-halophyte under salt stress at phenotypic and physiological levels. To explore the molecular mechanism of salinity tolerance in A. venetum, the global transcriptome profiles of seedling leaves under different salt-stress durations, using 200\u00a0mM NaCl, were analyzed. De novo assembly of approximately 715 million high-quality reads and approximately 105.61\u00a0Gb sequence data was performed. In total, 2822 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs were significantly enriched in flavonoid metabolism-related pathways such as \"flavonoid biosynthesis\" and \"phenylpropanoid biosynthesis\". Most of these DEGs were downregulated under salt stress. However, genes encoding the non-selective cation channels and antioxidants were upregulated under salt stress, whereas most cell wall-related DEGs were downregulated. Consequently, the concentration of flavonoids decreased, whereas that of Na<sup>+</sup> increased with exposure time. Thus, we hypothesized that the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in the leaves, which resulted in reduced flavonoid concentration under salt stress, directly led to a decrease in the salt tolerance of A. venetum. This was verified by overexpressing four flavonoid synthesis pathway genes in Arabidopsis. The transgenic plants showed higher salt tolerance than the wild-type plants due to the accumulation of total flavonoids. These physiological and transcriptome analyses of A. venetum revealed major molecular underpinnings contributing to the responses of A. venetum to salt stress, thereby improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in A. venetum and plants in general. The findings serve as a basis for functional studies on and engineering strategies for plant salinity tolerance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
