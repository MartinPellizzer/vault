They are known for their medicinal benefits and have been extensively used in healthcare industries and in the management of age-related diseases. This paper focuses on flavonoids from <i>Oroxylum indicum</i>, a significant medicinal tree in the practice of traditional Indian medicine. <i>O. indicum</i> has been utilized in a variety of polyherbal formulations for the management of musculoskeletal disorders, however the mechanism of action of its bioactive flavonoids remains unknown. The present study aimed to identify the flavonoids of <i>O. indicum</i> with the potential to target sclerostin, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling pathway for the treatment of bone-related disorders. Molecular docking, coarse-grained and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to screen the major flavonoids and investigate their interaction with sclerostin. Flavonoids with highest binding affinity and interacting with at least one of the amino acids of the PNAIG motif residues were selected from docking studies and subjected to further drug likeness and ADMET screening. Further screening from coarse-grained and molecular dynamic simulations results showed that baicalein, compared to other screened flavonoids, stably binds with the important residues of the LRP6 binding site of sclerostin, resulting in pronounced structural changes in the protein. These findings suggest that baicalein from <i>O. indicum</i> can potentially inhibit sclerostin and can elicit skeletal protective effects, providing an insight for further <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
