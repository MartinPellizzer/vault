In addition, other properties of serologically distinct BCMV strains were compared. Two groups of BCMV strains were obtained by ELISA and Western blot serology: serotype A contained the BCMV strains NL3, NL5, and NL8 and serotype B contained the BCMV strains NL1, NL2, NL4, NL6, US4, NL7, NY15, and Fla. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of freshly purified preparations, and of extracts from leaves infected with eleven BCMV strains showed that the apparent molecular mass of the capsid protein of the serotype A isolates NL3, NL5, and NL8 are lower (about M(r) 33,000) than those of the serotype B isolates (M(r) 34,500 to 35,000). The normal lengths of the particles of the serotype A isolates were shorter (810-818 nm) than those of most isolates (except NL6 and NY15) of serotype B (847-886 nm). All isolates studied induced cytoplasmic pinwheel and scroll inclusions. Cells infected with serotype A isolates contained a specific type of proliferated endoplasmic reticulum which was never found in cells infected with serotype B isolates. The capsid protein gene of a representative member of each serotype was cloned and sequenced. Molecular mass calculations based upon nucleotide sequence-derived amino acid sequences yielded M(r) of 29,662 and 32,489 for the capsid proteins of the serotype A isolate NL8 and the serotype B isolate NL4, respectively. Comparison of the coat-protein sequences showed considerable differences at the N-termini whereas the core regions and the C-termini appeared to be highly conserved. Marked differences were also observed within the 3' non-coding regions of cloned cDNAs of NL 4 and NL 8. The striking differences between the two serotypes of BCMV strongly suggest that they be classified as two distinct potyviruses which naturally infect Phaseolus beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biologische Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Institut f\u00fcr Biochemie und Pflanzenvirologie, Braunschweig, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "LastName": "Vetten", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lesemann", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maiss", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "9214275", "ISSNLinking": "0939-1983"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Introns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "RNA Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serotyping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1280510", "10.1007/978-3-7091-6920-9_44"]}}]}
