RA is the foremost cause of disability in developing and Western populations. It is an autoimmune disease-causing inflammation and pain involving synovial joints. Pro-inflammatory markers, including cytokines, such as interleukin -1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) are involved in RA. RA treatment involves TNF-\u03b1 blockade, B cell therapy, IL-1 and IL-6 blockade, and angiogenesis inhibition. Synthetic drugs available for the treatment of RA include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), such as cyclophosphamide, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and intramuscular gold. These agents induce adverse hepatorenal effects, hypertension, and gastric ulcers. We found that patients diagnosed with chronic pain, as in RA, and those refractory to contemporary management are most likely to seek traditional medicine. Approximately 60-90% of patients with arthritis use traditional medicines. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of these traditional medicines need to be established. The treatment for RA entails a comprehensive multidisciplinary strategy to reduce pain and inflammation and to restore the activity of joints. The potential medicinal plants exhibiting anti-arthritic and anti-rheumatic pharmacological activity are reviewed here."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
