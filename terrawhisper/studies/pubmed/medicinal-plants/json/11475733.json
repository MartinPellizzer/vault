Histopathology of the lungs was negatively correlated with the ginseng doses (r = -0.95, P < 0.01). The mast cell number in the lung foci in group I, II and IV was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Bacterial clearance in group II and group III was enhanced significantly (P < 0.05) compared with that in the control group. The specific antibody responses were down-regulated in group II, III and IV (P < 0.01), and IgM level in group I was lower compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Serum IgM level was positively correlated with the ginseng doses (r = 0.93, P < 0.05). IgG2a titer in group I was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05).
