In July 2022, the leaf spot symptoms were observed on over thirty P. \u00d7 fraseri plants in an approximately 2-hectare park in Xinjian District, Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, China (28\u00b043'02\u2033 N, 115\u00b044'01\u2033 E), with a disease incidences of roughly 10% . At first, small, grayish-white lesions appeared on the leaf edges, later expanding into 2 to 10 mm circular or irregular spots. These spots turned grayish-white to brown, with dark brown margins. Eventually, some lesions' centers dried and died. For fungal isolation, ten symptomatic leaves were randomly collected. The edges between the diseased and healthy tissues were cut into small pieces (4 \u00d7 4 mm). These pieces were then surface-sterilized by dipping in 70% ethanol for 30 s and 1% NaClO for 30 s. Subsequently, they were rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. Leaf pieces were then transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 3-4 days. Eight isolates with similar colony morphology were collected from diseased leaves. Colonies of this fungus on PDA were nearly round, white, and had sparse aerial mycelium on the surface with black, gregarious conidiomata. The conidia were nearly cylindrical, smooth, hyaline, and 4-septate, measuring 16.7 to 24.3 \u00d7 4.2 to 6.6 \u00b5m (mean 20.9 \u00d7 5.3 \u00b5m, n=50). The three middle cells were smooth, doliiform, and brown, with concolorous septa that were darker than the rest of the cell. They measured 11.8 to 17.0 \u00b5m long (mean 14.1 \u00b5m, n=50). The basal and apical cells were triangular and transparent. The basal cells had a mean length of 4.7 \u00b5m and were equipped with a basal appendage, while the apical cells had two appendages with a mean length of 17.7 \u00b5m(n=50). The characteristics of these isolates match those of Pestalotiopsis species (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). To identify them accurately, three representative isolates, namely JFRL 03-161, JFRL 03-162, and JFRL 03-226, were selected for further analysis. The internal transcriptional spacer (ITS) region, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-\u03b1) gene were amplified and sequenced using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), BT2a/BT2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and EF1-526F/EF1-1567R (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012), respectively. All sequences (ITS: OR342044-OR342046, TUB2: OR343299-OR343301, and TEF1-\u03b1: OR343302-OR343304) were deposited in GenBank. A BLASTn homology search revealed 99-100% identity to Pestalotiopsis nanjingensis CSUFTCC16 (ex-type). The sequences included ITS (OK493602, 486/486 nucleotides), TUB2 (OK562377, 438/439 nucleotides), and TEF1-\u03b1 (OK507972, 478/478 nucleotides). The maximum likelihood analyses were performed for the combined ITS, TUB2 and TEF1-\u03b1 data sets using IQtree web server (Trifinopoulos et al. 2016). The resulting phylogenetic tree demonstrated a strong association: the three isolates clustered tightly with P. nanjingensis forming a clade with robust 99% bootstrap support. This clustering, consistent with both morphological and molecular characteristics, confirmed the identity of the fungus as P. nanjingensis. To evaluate its pathogenicity, we obtained 3-year-old P. \u00d7 fraseri 'Red Robin' plants, which were purchased then potted in a controlled climate chamber. We surface sterilized six healthy leaves of P. \u00d7 fraseri with 70% ethanol and created wounds using a sterile needle. Subsequently, we inoculated a 50 \u03bcL conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/mL) of the isolate JFRL 03-161 on these wounded leaves. In parallel, another six leaves from P. \u00d7 fraseri were inoculated with sterile distilled water, serving as the control group. All potted plants were incubated under conditions of 26 \u00b0C and 80% humidity. After seven days, all leaves inoculated with isolate JFRL 03-161 displayed symptoms similar to those observed in the field, whereas the control leaves remained unaffected. To fulfill Koch's postulates, we re-isolated P. nanjingensis plants from the symptomatic leaves and identified it based on morphological and molecular characteristics. It has been reported that two species of Pestalotiopsis, namely P. microspora and P. trachicarpicola can caused damage to the leaves of P. \u00d7 fraseri in China (Xu et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2021). However, to our best knowledge, this is the first report on leaf spot caused by P. nanjingensis on P. \u00d7 fraseri in China. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the leaf spot disease of P. \u00d7 fraseri caused by Pestalotiopsis species and develop appropriate control strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JXAUNanchang, Jiangxi, China, 330200; 3554414021@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioengineering and Technological Research Centre for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; 1090087071@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Shunying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, College of Bioscience and Bioengineering, No. 1101 Zhimin Avenue, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China, 330045; 1459507544@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital, NO. 92, Aiguo Road, East lake district, Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330006; chunxiyang@139.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chunxi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhi Min AvenueNanchangNanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330045."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, Zhi Min Avenue, Zhi Min Avenue, China; cycui@jxau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Chaoyu", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38085969", "10.1094/PDIS-07-23-1469-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
