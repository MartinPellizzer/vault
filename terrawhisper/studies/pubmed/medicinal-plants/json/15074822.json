A commercial hydroponic system was adapted for this study and the wastewater was used to irrigate wooly digitalis (Digitalis lanata Ehrh.) and foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.). These plants are medicinal and produce cardenolide compounds. Influent and effluent samples were collected once a month for six months and analyzed to determine the various parameters relating to water quality. The legal discharge levels for total suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were reached for the two tested plants after 48 h of wastewater treatment; the removal was 82, 93, and 79%, respectively, for wooly digitalis and 92, 92, and 84%, respectively, for foxglove. Similar results were obtained during a 6-mo period although the sewage composition varied widely. The system tended to be unable to remove N and P to concentrations below regulated levels. Compared with the nutrient solution composition, the wastewater was more concentrated in Na+ and Cl- and less in N, K+, and Ca2+. These variations can lead to the decline of wooly digitalis plants. Foxglove developed a significant root system to increase mineral absorption wastewater being used as the unique nutritive source. After 10 wk all the wooly digitalis seedlings were dead. Despite this fact, however, the root system remained in place for a significant time (< 4 mo), thus continuing to filter wastewater and to be used as a bacterial support thus making it possible to have a security period to replace the dead plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Biologie et Physiologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tales, Universit\u00e9 de Reims, Champagne-Ardenne, UFR des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles, B\u00e2timent 18, Moulin de la Housse-BP 1039, 51687 REIMS Cedex 2, France. nathalie.vaillant@univ-reims.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaillant", "ForeName": "Nathalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monnet", "ForeName": "Fabien", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sallanon", "ForeName": "Huguette", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coudret", "ForeName": "Alain", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hitmi", "ForeName": "Adnane", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Qual", "NlmUniqueID": "0330666", "ISSNLinking": "0047-2425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15074822", "10.2134/jeq2004.6950"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
