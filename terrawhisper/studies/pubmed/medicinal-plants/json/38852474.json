Studies have identified 143 chemical compounds, including anthraquinones, anthrones, flavonoids, and chromones, which contribute to their broad pharmacological properties such as laxative, anti-diarrheal, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular, antidiabetic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. Notably, the materials science approach has enhanced understanding of their medicinal capabilities through the evaluation of bioactive compounds in different therapeutic contexts.", "As medicinal and economically significant herb species, Rheum species provide both edible aerial parts and medicinal underground components that offer substantial health benefits.
