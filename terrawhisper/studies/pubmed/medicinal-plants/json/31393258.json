Today, there is an increasing demand of medicinal plants as an anti-aging and anti-wrinkle agent. ; Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-aging and anti-wrinkle potential of Salvia officinalis. ; Materials and Methods: Salvia officinalis (Lamiaceae) is folk medicine of Asia and Latin America. Powdered crude drug 100 g was successively extracted in a soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether (60-80\u00baC), chloroform and methanol. After successive solvents, extraction methanolic extract was used for testing of antioxidant potential using DPPH assay. Further, the antiaging potential of the extract was investigated by the inhibitory effect of various enzymatic estimations i.e. Col-I, Ela- I and Hya-I inhibitory assays on early aging human skin fibroblasts. The antiwrinkle potential of plant Salvia officinalis was done by using a UV light-induced photoaging model. ; Results: Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of glycosides, alkaloids flavonoids, and triterpenoids, saponins and Phenolic Compounds at high level. The extract showed inhibitory concentration (IC50: 24.65) and ascorbic acid. The standard antioxidant showed inhibitory concentration (IC50: 20.10). In enzymatic estimations assay, the Col-I, Ela-I and Hya-I of extract were assessed showing inhibitory concentration as Col-I (IC50:21.36), Ela-I (IC50:35.05) and Hya-I (IC50:23.44), respectively. Thus, MeOH extract of Salvia officinalis can inhibit 50% of the activity of aging-related enzymes Col-I, Ela-I and Hya-I. The wrinkle score of negative control i.e. UV treated group was 2.83 \u00b1 0.408, and MeOH extract of Salvia officinalis treated group is 1.83 \u00b1 0.753. ; Conclusion: This study concluded that MeOH extract of Salvia officinalis has confirmed the high antioxidant potential and in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potential of antiaging enzymes assessed, thus they could be used for further development of cosmetic products and nutraceuticals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy and Research, People's University, Bhopal (M.P.) 462037, India."}], "LastName": "Khare", "ForeName": "Ruchi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy and Research, People's University, Bhopal (M.P.) 462037, India."}], "LastName": "Upmanyu", "ForeName": "Neeraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pinnacle Biomedical Research Institute, Bhopal (M.P.) 462003, India."}], "LastName": "Jha", "ForeName": "Megha", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Aging Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101473576", "ISSNLinking": "1874-6098"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia officinalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31393258", "10.2174/1874609812666190808140549", "CAS-EPUB-100220"]}}]}
