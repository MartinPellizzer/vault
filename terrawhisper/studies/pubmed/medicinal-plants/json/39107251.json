Autoimmunity is held to be one of the most frequent causes, but little is known about the expression and relevance of autoimmunity-driving genes in CSU, such as STAT3, STAT1, IL-27p28, and IL-12p35.", "To investigate CSU patients or the expression of STAT3, STAT1, IL-27p28, and IL-12p35 and possible links to clinical features.", "Gene expression levels, in 26 CSU patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs), were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. CSU patients were assessed for total IgE and IgG-anti-TPO, markers of autoimmune CSU.", "Patients with CSU showed significantly higher expression of STAT3, but not STAT1, and 17 and 10 of 26 CSU patients had elevated STAT3 expression and STAT3/STAT1 ratios, respectively, as compared to only 1 of 19 HCs. High STAT3 expression and STAT3/STAT1 ratios were linked to low IgE and elevated IgG-anti-TPO. As compared to HCs, CSU patients had markedly lower and correlated IL-27p28 and IL-12p35 mRNA expression levels. Low IL-27p28 and IL-12p35 expression levels were linked to higher STAT3/STAT1 ratios and low IgE.", "STAT3 upregulation, higher STAT3/STAT1 ratios, and IL-27p28 and IL-12p35 downregulation cluster with features of autoimmune CSU. The role of STAT3 as a potential pathogenic driver of autoimmune CSU and target of treatment should be explored further."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
