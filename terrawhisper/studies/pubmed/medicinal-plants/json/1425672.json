It shows saturation kinetics Km = 1 mM like a substrate, but its interaction leads to time-dependent loss of enzyme activity which is not restored by gel filtration. The substrate 1,4-diaminobutane and the competitive inhibitor 1,4-diamino-2-butanone protect the enzyme against inactivation. Changes in the enzyme electronic spectra with 1,4-diamino-2-butyne were found. The mechanism of the interaction involves an intermediate aminoallenic compound, which is formed with covalent bound pyrrole in the reaction of the nucleophile with the enzyme. The presence of a pyrrole in the inactivated enzyme was confirmed by reaction with Ehrlich's reagent. The kinetic data obtained in this study indicate that 1,4-diamino-2-butyne is a mechanism-based inactivator with number of turnovers, r = 17 and characteristic constants K' = 0.32 mM and k(in) = 4.89 min-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical and Organic Chemistry, Palack\u00fd University, Faculty of Science, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia."}], "LastName": "Pec", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fr\u00e9bort", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53878-96-9", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-diamino-2-butyne"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1425672", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17333.x"]}}]}
