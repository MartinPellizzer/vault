The knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) people hold towards this new disease could play a major role in the way they accept measures put in place to curb its spread and their willingness to seek and adhere to care. We sought to understand if: a) demographic variables of Cameroonian residents could influence KAP and symptomatology, and b) KAP could influence the risk of having COVID19.A cross-sectional KAP/symptomatology online survey was conducted between April 20 to May 20. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 23. Of all respondents (1006), 53.1% were female, 26.6% were students, 26.9% interacted face to face and 62.8% were residents in Yaound\u00e9 with a median age of 33. The overall high score was 84.19% for knowledge, 69% for attitude, and 60.8% for practice towards COVID 19. Age > 20 years was associated with a high knowledge of COVID 19. Women had lower practice scores compared to men (OR = 0.72; 95%CI 0.56-0.92). 41 respondents had \u22653 symptoms and only 9 (22.95%) of them had called 1510 (emergency number). There was no significant difference between KAP and symptomatology. The presence of \u2265 3 symptoms in 4% of respondents (with 56% of them having co-morbidities) supports the current trend in the number of confirmed cases (8681) in Cameroon. The continuous increase in the number of cases and the overall good KAP warrants further investigation to assess the effectiveness of the measures put in place to curb the spread of the disease. Sensitization is paramount to preclude negative health-seeking behaviors and encourage positive preventive and therapeutic practices, for fear of an increase in mortality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9469-3618"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ngwewondo", "ForeName": "Adela", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Nkengazong", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ambe", "ForeName": "Lum Abienwi", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4057-889X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ebogo", "ForeName": "Jean Thierry", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1677-8859"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Mba", "ForeName": "Fabrice Medou", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6957-5302"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Goni", "ForeName": "Hamadama Oumarou", "Initials": "HO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Nyuna\u00ef", "ForeName": "Nyemb", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ngonde", "ForeName": "Marie Chantal", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Centre of Medical Research, B.P.6163 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Oyono", "ForeName": "Jean-Louis Essame", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS Negl Trop Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101291488", "ISSNLinking": "1935-2727"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Betacoronavirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Coronavirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Primary Prevention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Zhonghua L, Xing BX, Za ZZ, Liuxingbingxue Z.
