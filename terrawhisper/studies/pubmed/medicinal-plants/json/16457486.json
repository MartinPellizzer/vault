Air samples were collected on glass fibre filters by use of personal samplers on 13 farms owned by herb cultivating farmers, located in Lublin province (eastern Poland). The concentrations of total viable microorganisms (bacteria + fungi) in the farm air during processing of peppermint herb were large, within a range from 895.1-6,015.8 x 10(3) cfu/m(3) (median 1,055.3 x 10(3) cfu/m(3)). During processing of chamomile herb they were much lower and varied within a range from 0.88-295.6 x 10(3) cfu/m(3) (median 27.3 x 10(3) cfu/m(3)). Gram-negative bacteria distinctly prevailed during processing of peppermint leaves, forming 46.4-88.5 % of the total airborne microflora. During processing of chamomile herb, Gram-negative bacteria were dominant at 3 out of 6 sampling sites forming 54.7-75.3 % of total microflora, whereas at the remaining 3 sites the most common were fungi forming 46.2-99.9 % of the total count. The species Pantoea agglomerans (synonyms: Erwinia herbicola, Enterobacter agglomerans ), having strong allergenic and endotoxic properties, distinctly prevailed among Gram-negative isolates. Among fungi, the most common species was Alternaria alternata. The concentrations of airborne dust and endotoxin determined on the examined herb farms were large. The concentrations of airborne dust during peppermint and chamomile processing ranged from 86.7-958.9 mg/m(3), and from 1.1-499.2 mg/m(3), respectively (medians 552.3 mg/m(3) and 12.3 mg/m(3)). The concentrations of airborne endotoxin determined during peppermint and chamomile processing were within a wide range 1.53-208.33 microg/m(3) and 0.005-2604.19 microg/m(3) respectively (medians 57.3 microg/m(3) and 0.96 microg/m(3)). In conclusion, farmers cultivating peppermint are exposed during processing of this herb to large concentrations of airborne microorganisms, dust and endotoxin posing a risk of work-related respiratory disease. The exposure to bioaerosols during processing of chamomile is lower; nevertheless, peak values create a respiratory risk for exposed farmers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Biohazards, Institute of Agricultural Medicine, Jaczewskiego 2, 20-090 Lublin, Poland. skorska@op.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sk\u00f3rska", "ForeName": "Czes\u0142awa", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sitkowska", "ForeName": "Jolanta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krysi\u0144ska-Traczyk", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cholewa", "ForeName": "Grazyna", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dutkiewicz", "ForeName": "Jacek", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Agric Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9500166", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1966"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Agricultural Workers' Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16457486", "12281"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
