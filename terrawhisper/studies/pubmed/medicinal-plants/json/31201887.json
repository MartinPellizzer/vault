NMDA receptors are glutamate-coupled ion channels that critically involved in survival of neuronal cells and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is considered a promising target for the therapy of neurodegenerative disease. In this study, four catechins including two new catechins derivatives (1-2), together with thirteen known flavonoids were isolated from Anhua dark tea. The structures of compounds 1-2 [2S,3R-6-methoxycarbonylgallocatechin (1) and 2R,3R-6-methoxycarbonylgallocatechin (2)] were determined on the basis of their spectroscopic data. The preliminary bioassay indicated that compound 1 showed the best neuroprotective effects via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors inhibition. Compound 1 protected SH-SY5Y cells against NMDA-induced injury and cell apoptosis via the modulation of NR2B expression, the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling and caspase-dependent pathway. The results suggested compound 1 would be a potent dietary therapy reagent for prevention of excitable brain injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
