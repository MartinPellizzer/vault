Recent investigations have shown that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac injury pathophysiology. Gum-resin extracts of Boswellia serrata have been traditionally used in folk medicine for centuries to treat various chronic inflammatory diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of B. serrata pretreatment on LPS-induced cardiac damage in H9c2 cells. The cells were pretreated with various concentrations of B. serrata (5-45\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 24\u00a0h and then stimulated with LPS (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for another 24\u00a0h. Afterward, the levels of cell viability, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, prostaglandin (PGE)-2, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real time-PCR or appropriated biochemical methods. Our results demonstrated that LPS treatment caused a remarkable decrease in cell viability and GSH, and on the contrary, it led to a significant increase in the levels of gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers and NO. However, pretreatment of B. serrata (5, 15, and 45\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) decreased the levels of TNF-\u03b1, PGE2, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, iNOS, IL-6, and NO production, while cell viability and GSH levels were increased. Taken together, our results demonstrated that B. serrata might be a potential therapeutic agent against LPS and endotoxemia-induced cardiac injury, through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
