Seem is widely used as a medicinal plant and functional food in China. In this study, A. elata plants were exposed to full sunlight (CK), 40% shading (LS), 60% shading (MS), and >80% shading (ES) condition to investigate the effects of shading treatments on growth, stress levels, antioxidant enzymes activity, araloside content and related gene expression. The greatest growth and leaf biomass were achieved in 40% shading, and leaf biomass per plant increased by 16.09% compared to the non-shading treatment. Furthermore, the lowest reactive oxide species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation resulting from increasing antioxidant enzyme activity were also observed in LS treatment. Overall, shading percentage negatively regulated the expression of key enzymes (squalene synthase, SS; squalene epoxidase, SE and \u03b2-amyrin synthase, bAS) involved in the saponin biosynthesis, resulting in the greatest yields of total and four selected aralosides in A. elata leaves were achieved in sunlight group. However, the greatest yield of total saponin in the leaves was observed in the 40% shading group due to higher leaf biomass. The results suggest that optimizing the field growing conditions would be important for obtaining the greatest yield of bioactive components. Total saponin and selected aralosides also have a significant correlation with ROS production and antioxidant enzyme activity, these indicated the increased yield of these saponins may be part of a defense response. The study concludes that the production of saponin was the interaction of oxidative stress and photosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
