Leaves/bulk from the plants were crushed and extracted with organic solvents by three different ways. The first group of plants were extracted with CHCL3:CH3OH (2:1), evaporated, partitioned between petroleum ether and methanol (9:1), aqueous methanolic part re-partitioned between methanol:H2O (4:1) and dichloromethane. Methanol was evaporated from the aqueous methanolic part and extracted with n-butanol. The second group of plants were extracted with methanol followed by partitioning between petroleum ether and CH3OH. The rest of the extraction procedure was the same as above. A third extraction procedure was used for Ocimum sanctum which after extraction with CHCL3:CH3OH (2:1), partitioned between CCL4 and CH3OH:H2O (9:1). Aqueous methanolic part was repartitioned between CH3OH:H2O (4:1) and CHCl3 and CHCl3 soluble part was used for the study. Free radical scavenging activities of the plant extracts were examined by chemiluminescence method. Peroxyl radical was generated from 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), superoxide radical (O2-) from xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XO) and hydroxyl radical (OH) from Xanthine/XO/FeCl3/ EDTA. In addition, O2- and OH. scavenging activities were also determined by cytochrome C reduction and deoxyribose oxidation methods, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that these plant extracts possess potent antioxidant activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030-1110, USA."}], "LastName": "Maulik", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maulik", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhandari", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kagan", "ForeName": "V E", "Initials": "VE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pakrashi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 22559", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL 34360", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome c Group"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "533-67-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome c Group"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9350426", "10.3109/10715769709097854"]}}]}
