Data was collected using the multi-method approach of descriptive review, semi-structured interviews with traditional medical practitioners, and brief scientific review. Traditional Akan medicine is holistic and does not separate the physical world from the supernatural world. It is deeply rooted in traditional religion, with illness seen as a departure from the natural equilibrium. Traditional healers are either spiritually based or non-spiritually based. This study found the traditional knowledge of healing and use of medicinal plants is disseminated through generations by family members. However, the acquisition of academic qualifications is now a priority, and formal training is taking place in the workplace and a university. Techniques used in diagnosis and treatment consist of a fusion of traditional and biomedical methods. Treatment of hypertension was used as an example, with all practitioners recognizing hypertension's clinical signs and symptoms. Medicinal plants are predominantly wildcrafted and dispensed mainly by decoction, although prepared formulas are given. To prevent self-medication, patients are seen frequently. Scientific evidence validates the pharmacological actions of the medicinal plants. Public health care in Ghana is accessed by a cash and carry system that is only available to those who can afford it. Approximately 75 percent of the population depends on traditional medicine for primary health care. A national health insurance scheme was introduced in 2004, and it has been proposed that traditional medicine will be integrated into this new system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abel", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Busia", "ForeName": "Kofi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Med Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "9705340", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5159"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15989380"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
