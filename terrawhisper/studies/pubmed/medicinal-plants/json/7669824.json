Patients gave global statements about how satisfied they were with the various treatments they had experienced. Many patients received treatments that have never been investigated under controlled conditions. The most common drug treatments, in descending order, were: 48% benzodiazepines, 42% tricyclic antidepressants, 32% herbal preparations, 29% neuroleptics, 7% selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 6% beta blockers. Of the drug prescriptions, 63% were according to international standards. Of the neuroleptics, two-thirds (63.3%) were prescribed by nonpsychiatric physicians, and only one-third by psychiatrists (33.3%). Tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed more often by psychiatrists (64.7%) than by non-psychiatrists (31.4%). Among psychological treatments, autogenic training (43% of the patients) and psychodynamic therapy (33%) were used far more frequently than behavioural/cognitive therapy (20%). These results confirm the underutilisation of available effective treatments for panic disorder (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants or behavioural therapy) and the overutilisation of treatments without proven efficacy (e.g. herbal preparations or autogenic training). Patients were most satisfied with treatments that have been proven effective in controlled studies. Among drug treatments, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants were favoured (mean on a 0-4 scale indicating effectiveness: 2.6, 2.6 and 2.4). Neuroleptics (1.4), beta-blockers (1.0) and herbal preparations (0.9) were not rated highly effective by the patients. Among psychological treatments, patients were more satisfied with behavioural/cognitive therapy (2.6) than with psychodynamic therapies (1.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Bandelow", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sievert", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "R\u00f6themeyer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hajak", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "R\u00fcther", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "9103030", "ISSNLinking": "0940-1334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12794-10-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzodiazepines"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 1995;246(1):62"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "psychology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Agoraphobia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzodiazepines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "psychology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Panic Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Psychiatry. 1989 Nov;146(11):1423-6", "ArticleIdList": ["2817112"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl. 1991;365:7-17", "ArticleIdList": ["1862735"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1988 May;45(5):413-22", "ArticleIdList": ["3282478"]}, {"Citation": "J Clin Psychiatry. 1986 Mar;47(3):117-22", "ArticleIdList": ["3512534"]}, {"Citation": "J Clin Psychopharmacol. 1991 Dec;11(6):344-50", "ArticleIdList": ["1770152"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1993 May 13;328(19):1398-405", "ArticleIdList": ["8292115"]}, {"Citation": "CMAJ. 1992 Sep 15;147(6):878-83", "ArticleIdList": ["1525731"]}, {"Citation": "Br J Med Psychol. 1959;32(1):50-5", "ArticleIdList": ["13638508"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1983 Feb;40(2):153-62", "ArticleIdList": ["6130752"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1987 Apr;44(4):377-85", "ArticleIdList": ["2882736"]}, {"Citation": "Br J Psychiatry. 1968 Oct;114(515):1263-74", "ArticleIdList": ["4880978"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1988 May;45(5):453-9", "ArticleIdList": ["3282481"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1986 Nov;43(11):1029-36", "ArticleIdList": ["3767595"]}, {"Citation": "J Nerv Ment Dis. 1987 Oct;175(10):584-94", "ArticleIdList": ["3309185"]}, {"Citation": "J Psychiatr Res. 1993;27 Suppl 1:97-110", "ArticleIdList": ["7908335"]}, {"Citation": "Int Clin Psychopharmacol. 1995 Jun;10(2):73-81", "ArticleIdList": ["7673659"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1980 Jan;37(1):51-9", "ArticleIdList": ["7352840"]}, {"Citation": "J Consult Clin Psychol. 1990 Feb;58(1):77-84", "ArticleIdList": ["2319048"]}, {"Citation": "Behav Res Ther. 1983;21(4):393-9", "ArticleIdList": ["6626109"]}, {"Citation": "Br J Psychiatry. 1992 Feb;160:191-202;
