The quantities of the total phenolic compounds of methanolic extract of the two lichen extracts were determined to be 1.46% and 2.62%, respectively. In order to evaluate the antioxidative effects of the extracts, we also measured electron donating abilities (EDA) and lipid peroxidation rates. The EDA values measured by the reduction of 1.1''-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were 72.8% and 80.7% for the extracts, with SC50 (median scavenging concentration) values of 1.29+/-0.05 mg/ml and 1.03+/-0.06 mg/ml, respectively. The rates of inhibition of lipid peroxidation using linoleic acid were 92.1% and 97.3% for the extracts, with IC50 (median inhibitory concentration) values of 0.57+/-0.05 mg/ml and 0.53+/-0.06 mg/ml, respectively. The inhibitory rates of the extracts against tyrosinase were 67.4% and 84.8%, respectively. The extracts were shown to reduce melanin formation in human melanoma cells. Melanin contents in the samples treated with 0.01% and 0.1% U. esculenta were 47.1% and 31.2%, respectively, and those treated with 0.01% and 0.1% Usnea longissima were 51.1% and 34.9%, respectively, whereas a value of 54.0% was registered when ascorbic acid was utilized as a positive control. In addition to direct tyrosinase inhibition, it was determined that the lichen extracts affected the activity of tyrosinase via the inhibition of tyrosinase glycosylation. As a result, the methanolic extracts of U. esculenta and Usnea longissima evidenced melanogenesis inhibitory effects, which occurred via multiple routes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center, Macrocare Tech Ltd, Ochang, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Moo-Sung", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Hong-Bum", "Initials": "HB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9703165", "ISSNLinking": "1225-8873"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lichens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Usnea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18176544", "2605"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
