(Lamiaceae) and Verbascum fruticulosum Post. (Scrophulariaceae) was evaluated in this study via the Prothrombin time (PT) and Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) analysis. Aqueous, methanol and ethanol extracts of the examined plant species leaves were prepared to a final concentration 50 mg/mL. In vitro PT and aPTT assays were conducted on normal platelet poor plasma blood samples by a digital coagulation analyzer. The obtained results revealed anticoagulation activity of all investigated plant species with observed variations among them. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of T. spicata as well as the aqueous extract of S. thymbra prolonged PT values significantly (p < 0.05). While, all V. fruticulosum extract types have had no significant effect on the PT values. The recorded aPTT data showed that all aqueous extracts have had a significant effect on the blood haemostasis as they increased aPTT values in all plant species under study. Out of which, both the ethanol and methanol extracts of T. spicata and methanol extract of S. thymbra showed similar effect. Of great concern, it was clearly noticed that the aqueous and ethanol extract of T. spicata and the aqueous extract of S. thymbra possess the strongest anticoagulation effect as they increased both PT and aPTT values significantly relative to the control (p < 0.05). The variable anticoagulation bioactivity among the studied plant species could be referred to the various solvents degrees of solubility of different phyto-constituents. Thus, the efficacy of the plant species extracts evaluation as anticoagulants or coagulants were related to the plant species and to the solvent of extraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0916-1997"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine."}], "LastName": "Omar", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7656-2673"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine."}], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4994-6812"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine."}], "LastName": "Barakat", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8245-0694"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine."}], "LastName": "Othman", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2649-3686"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine."}], "LastName": "Bourinee", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemostatics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemostasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemostatics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31800761", "10.1590/1519-6984.219186", "S1519-69842019005019106"]}}]}
