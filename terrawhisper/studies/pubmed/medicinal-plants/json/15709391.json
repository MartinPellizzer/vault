The PCR products of 4096 genes were spotted on the chip after a serial of treatment. The mixed probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarray. Axon Genepix 4000B and GenePixPro 3.0 software were used to scan and analyze the fluorescent signals.", "The expressions of 199 and 12 genes were found up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in the vehicle group compared with the sham-operation one. But the numbers of genes whose expressions were up-regulated and down-regulated were 89 and 88, respectively, when comparing the gene expression in the Baicalin-treated rat brain with that in the vehicle group. Moreover, one down-regulated and three up-regulated genes in the vehicle group were up-regulated and down-regulated in the Baicalin-treated group, respectively. Expressions of three up-regulated genes in the vehicle group were further reinforced in the Baicalin-treatment group.", "Multiple pathways and nodes may be involved in the pharmacological effect of Baicalin on brain ischemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi Yuan Hospital of China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100091, China. zhonw@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhan-jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-xun", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Cui-e", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-yan", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vimentin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "347Q89U4M5", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.40", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvate Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "GTP-Binding Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "GTP-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvate Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vimentin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15709391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
