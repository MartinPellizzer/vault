Online energy-resolved MS (ER-MS) provides the opportunity to acquire the trajectory of ion intensity against CE for any fragment ion of interest, thus exactly offering the desired momentum to empower the conventional MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum at a certain CE forward to a full-CE ramp MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum (FCER-MS<sup>2</sup>). Efforts were made here to construct an FCER-MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum and to evaluate its potential toward structural analysis. Flavonoids were employed as a proof of concept. MS<sup>2</sup> spectra of 76 compounds were recorded by LC-Q-Exactive-MS, and online ER-MS was subsequently programmed using LC-Qtrap-MS to build a breakdown graph for each obvious fragment ion. After defining the greatest value amongst all regressive apices as 100%, the normalized breakdown graphs comprised an FCER-MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum for each compound. The FCER-MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum contained the MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum at any CE as well as optimal CE (OCE) and maximal relative ion intensity (RII<sub>max</sub>) of each fragment ion. Except the pronounced isomeric discrimination potential, either OCE or RII<sub>max</sub> reflected certain structural properties, such as aglycone, glycosidic bond, and hydroxy, methoxy, and glycosyl substituents. These rules were subsequently applied for flavonoid-focused characterization of a famous herbal medicine, namely Scutellariae Radix, and high-level structural annotation was accomplished for 75 flavonoids. Above all, the FCER-MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum includes <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>, OCEs, and RII<sub>max</sub> features, thus facilitating confidence-advanced structural analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Pengwei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wenjing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Huiting", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Huixia", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6750-2617"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Avenida da Universidade, Taipa 999078, Macao."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Jian-Bo", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8771-7877"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, 38 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3553-1840"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Pengfei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8243-5267"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9431-6257"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, East Road of North 3rd Ring, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yuelin", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34775745", "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
