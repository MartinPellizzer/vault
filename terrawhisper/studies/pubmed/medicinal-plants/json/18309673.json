Rats were injected respectively with diethyl stilbestrol and progesterone. The immune apparatus of rats were measured. The levels of CD3, CD4 and CD4/ CD8 in serum were determined by flow cytometer. The estrogen and receptor were measured by radioligand binding assay and pathologic changes of womb tissue were observed microscopically.", "Compared with normal group, the weight of thymus, the levels of CD3, CD4 and CD4/CD8 of model group were significantly decreased, and the levels of estrogen, estrogen receptor and CD8 were obviously increased. Jincao tablet groups were significant difference compared with model group and could alleviate the pathological changes of womb tissue.", "Jincao tablet could improve the levels of immune function of the model of hysteromyoma in rat, and it might play a role in the pathogenesis of leiomyoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.
