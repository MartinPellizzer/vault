The 3- [chloro (7)] and 3, 5-[dinitro (8)] benzoic acid ester derivatives were most active (MIC 25 ug/ml) against the pathogen. Further, in silico docking studies of the active derivative 7 with mycobacterium enzyme inhA (enoyl-ACP reductase) gave the LibDock score of 152.68 and binding energy of -208.62 and formed three hydrogen bonds with SER94, MET98, and SER94. Similarly, when derivative 8 docked with inhA, it gave the LibDock score of 113.55 and binding energy of -175.46 and formed a single hydrogen bond with GLN100 and Pi-interaction with PHE97. On the other hand, the known standard drug isoniazid (INH) gave the LibDock score of 61.63, binding energy of -81.25 and formed one hydrogen bond with ASP148. These molecular docking results and the way of binding pattern indicated that compounds 7 and 8 bound well within the binding pocket of inhA and showed a higher binding affinity than the known drug isoniazid. Additionally, both the derivatives (7 and 8) showed no cytotoxicity, with CC50 195.10 and 111.36, respectively towards the mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "LastName": "Bhukya", "ForeName": "Balakishan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic &amp; Structural Biology Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Sarfaraz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226001, India."}], "LastName": "Chaturvedi", "ForeName": "Vinita", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226001, India."}], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow-2260, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Shailesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic &amp; Structural Biology Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Feroz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "Arvind S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Santosh Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Taxoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "brevifoliol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Esterification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Taxoids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32484109", "10.2174/1568026620666200528155236", "CTMC-EPUB-106961"]}}]}
