At present, bioactive compounds from traditional medicinal plants have received much attention for the enhancement of cognitive function. Danshensu, a phenolic acid isolated from herbal medicines, has various pharmacological activities in the central nervous system, including anxiolytic-like and neuroprotective properties. The present study aimed to investigate the ameliorating effects of danshensu on scopolamine- and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein-induced cognitive impairments in mice. Danshensu (3 and 10\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) effectively ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice, as measured in passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks. In a mechanistic study, danshensu inhibited monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity but not MAO-B. Additionally, danshensu treatment increased the dopamine level and the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), in the cortex of the brain. Furthermore, the ameliorating effect of danshensu against scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment was fully blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. Finally, danshensu also ameliorated A\u03b2-induced cognitive impairments in an animal model of AD. The results revealed that danshensu treatment significantly improved scopolamine and A\u03b2-induced cognitive impairments in mice by facilitation of dopamine signaling cascade such as PKA and CREB due to MAO-A inhibition. Thus, danshensu could be used as a promising therapeutic agent for preventing and treating AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
