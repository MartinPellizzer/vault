Structurally, compounds <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> have a 14-membered paracyclophane ring system that was closed through an ether bond between the \u03b2-hydroxy amino acid and tyrosine and modified with a 4,5-methylenedioxybenzoyloxy (MDBz, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>) or hexanoyl (Hexa, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>6</b>) group at the N-terminus. Interestingly, this is the first report on the isolation and characterization of CPABs from plants of the Simaroubaceae family. In addition, all compounds showed a neuroprotective effect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged SH-SY5Y cells. Compound <b>1</b> was further investigated for its neuroprotective activities using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease animal model, and it dramatically improved MPTP-impaired motor behavioral performance. Biochemical analysis revealed compound <b>1</b> restored the tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum of the MPTP-damaged mouse brain, which demonstrates its protective effect on dopaminergic neurons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources, Key
