Most of the drugs used are believed to be safe, but some drugs may have toxins and produce harmful effects, so it is very important to remove the toxins or to minimize their harmful effects before using, so as to increase their therapeutic values and make easy for use.", "To explore the concept, aims and objectives of islah-e-advia (rectification/purification of drugs) in Unani system of medicine.", "A through literature survey was undertaken using the various online bibliographic databases like Pub Med, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus. Classical Unani literature books which are translated in Urdu by CCRUM were used for Unani references. The keywords used for the search included \"Tadbeer-e-Advia\", \"Islah-e-advia\", Mudabbar process, detoxification and purification of drug.", "The ancient Unani physicians were well aware of toxicity of the drugs and have divided drugs into four degrees (1\u00b0, 2\u00b0, 3\u00b0 and 4\u00b0) according to the Mizaj (temperament) of drugs. The fourth degree drugs produce so strong effects that the physiological functions of the body get disturbed; such drugs are also considered to be poisonous drugs. Different methods of purification have been mentioned for drugs belonging to the third and fourth degree temperament and always recommended their use after subjecting them to certain Tadbeer (rectification/purification). Otherwise these drugs may destroy the physiological function of the body. After purification process the drugs become physically and chemically pure, therapeutically more effective and less toxic. Very few pharmacological and toxicity studies have been conducted.", "Third and fourth degree drugs and its formulations have been claimed by Unani scholars to be useful in the management of various diseases of the body. After purification toxicity has been reduced in comparison crude drug. However, further elaborate and comprehensive studies are required to validate such claims."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
