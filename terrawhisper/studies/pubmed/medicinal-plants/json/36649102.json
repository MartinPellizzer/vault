If antimicrobials are continually used in dairy farms, this may result in antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, investigation of antimicrobial resistance and finding new alternative methods for inhibiting ESBL-producing E. coli is essential. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected antimicrobials to inhibit E. coli ATCC 25922, control bacteria and ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from dairy farms. We also investigated the capacity of polyphenol extract from 10 varieties of medicinal plants to inhibit ESBL-producing E. coli using a broth microdilution method. It was found that control bacteria were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents, i.e., ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, imipenem, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim. However, ESBL-producing E. coli exhibited both susceptibility and resistance to selected antimicrobials. The polyphenol extracted from Psidium guajava Linn at the lowest concentration was 4.5 mg/mL, which could inhibit control bacteria, but at the same concentration could not inhibit ESBL-producing E. coli. These phenomena indicated that ESBL-producing E. coli had both susceptibility and resistance to antimicrobials. Polyphenol, which could inhibit non-resistant E. coli, could not inhibit ESBL-producing E. coli."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Polish Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioveterinary Research Unit, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Konputtar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stress and Oxidative Stress in Animals Research Unit, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Mahasarakham University, Maha Sarakham 44000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Aengwanich", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Saraphol", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioveterinary Research Unit, Mahasarakham University, 79 Nakhonsawan Road, Talad, Maung, Maha Sarakham, 44000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Yossapol", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pol J Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101125473", "ISSNLinking": "1505-1773"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.2.6", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Lactamases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta-Lactamases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36649102", "10.24425/pjvs.2022.142038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
