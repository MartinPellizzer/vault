Rutin, a natural compound present in various medicinal plants, has been shown to protect against chemotherapy-induced toxicities. In this study, we explored the protective effect of rutin against the dose-dependent cardiotoxic effects of cisplatin such as perfusion pressure, histopathologic effect on the myocardium, and oxidative stress in isolated perfused rat hearts. Methodology The cardiotoxic effects of cisplatin were studied at three dosages (1, 7, and 14 mg/L) in isolated perfused rat hearts. The dose-dependent, cisplatin-induced toxic effects on left ventricular pressure (LVP), heart rate (HR), dp/dt (maximum), dp/dt (minimum), perfusion pressure, pressure-time index, contractility index, and duration of diastole were assessed. The effects of cisplatin were measured one minute before perfusion of cisplatin and 60 minutes after perfusion of the isolated rat hearts. Results Cisplatin (1-14 mg/L) caused a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in LVP. The percentage LVP values reduced from 94 \u00b1 9 (control untreated hearts) to 70 \u00b1 6, 69 \u00b1 5, and 65 \u00b1 4 in hearts treated with 1, 7, and 14 mg/L of cisplatin, respectively. Similarly, cisplatin at similar doses caused a marked reduction in the values of dp/dt (maximum), dp/dt (minimum), and pressure-time index in isolated rat hearts. The respective percentage values of these parameters compared to those of untreated hearts were significantly reduced from 101 \u00b1 7 to 72 \u00b1 5, 92 \u00b1 8 to 69 \u00b1 4, and 92 \u00b1 12 to 57 \u00b1 7 in hearts treated with 14 mg/L of cisplatin. Perfusion of hearts with rutin trihydrate (1 \u00b5M/L) 10 minutes before administration of cisplatin and throughout the experiment attenuated the detrimental effects of cisplatin on cardiac functions in isolated rat hearts (p < 0.05). In addition, cisplatin-induced degeneration and necrosis of cardiac muscle cells reduced with the concurrent administration of rutin and restored normal heart histology. Moreover, cisplatin-induced reduction in glutathione and increased level of malondialdehyde in the myocardium was reversed by concurrent administration of rutin in isolated rat hearts. Conclusions Cisplatin produced a dose-dependent impairment of several parameters of cardiac function such as LVP, contractility index, and pressure-time index. It caused histopathological alterations in isolated rat hearts. These harmful effects of cisplatin were suppressed by rutin trihydrate, suggesting the potential protective effects of rutin against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity. Rutin trihydrate also improved the reduced glutathione contents and suppressed the\u00a0malondialdehyde contents in the cardiac tissue of isolated rat hearts, suggesting that the observed beneficial effects of rutin trihydrate in this study could be related to its antioxidant properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022, Bukhari et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Bukhari", "ForeName": "Ishfaq A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Osama Y", "Initials": "OY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Alhowikan", "ForeName": "Abdulrahman M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Lateef", "ForeName": "Rahmathunnisa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Hagar", "ForeName": "Hanan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Assiri", "ForeName": "Raghad A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Wa'ad Massoud A", "Initials": "WMA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Cisplatin: a review of clinical applications and renal toxicity.
