The qualified SHR models were selected. The primary aortic endothelial cells(VECs) of rats were separated and cultured by ligation and adherence, followed by subculture. After successful identification, an UPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneously determining the contents of GA, PCA, NCA, CA, CCA, PDG, PG in seven components of Eucommiae Cortex in VECs was established, including specificity, linearity, matrix effect, recovery, accuracy, precision and stability. The established method had the lo-west limit of quantification of 0.97-4.95 \u03bcg\u00b7L~(-1), accuracy of 87.26%-109.6%, extraction recovery of 89.23%-105.3%, matrix effect of 85.86%-106.2%, and stability of 86.00%-112.5%. Therefore, the established accurate UPLC-MS/MS method could rapidly and simultaneously determine the contents of the seven active components of Eucommiae Cortex in VECs of SHRs, which provided a refe-rence for the study of cellular pharmacokinetics of active components of Eucommiae Cortex extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
