However, some inevitable limitations associated with these secondary metabolites like high cytotoxicity, low bioavailability, poor absorption, low abundance, improper metabolism, etc., have forced the scientific community to explore medicinal plants for alternate biologically active molecules. In this context, therapeutically active proteins/peptides from medicinal plants have been promoted as a promising therapeutic intervention for various human diseases. A large number of proteins isolated from the medicinal plants have been shown to exhibit anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-HIV, anticancerous, ribosome-inactivating and neuro-modulatory activities. Moreover, with advanced technological developments in the medicinal plant research, medicinal plant proteins such as Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor and Mistletoe Lectin-I are presently under clinical trials against prostate cancer, oral carcinomas and malignant melanoma. Despite these developments and proteins being potential drug candidates, to date, not a single systematic review article has documented the therapeutical potential of the available biologically active medicinal plant proteome. The present article was therefore designed to describe the current status of the therapeutically active medicinal plant proteins/peptides vis-\u00e0-vis their potential as future protein-based drugs for various human diseases. Future insights in this direction have also been highlighted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Srinagar-190006, Jammu and Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Wani", "ForeName": "Snober Shabeer", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Srinagar-190006, Jammu and Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Dar", "ForeName": "Parvaiz A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Plant Biotechnology, S.
