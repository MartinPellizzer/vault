In August 2021, leaf blotch symptoms were observed on roughly 20% of leaves of D. odora var. marginata plants in Fenghuangzhou Citizen Park, Nanchang city (28\u00b041'48.12\u2033 N, 115\u00b052'40.47\u2033 E), Jiangxi Province, China. Brown lesions first appeared on the edges of leaves, which eventually dried and died (Fig. 1A). For fungal isolation, 12 symptomatic leaves were randomly collected, the edges between diseased area and healthy area were cut into small pieces (4\u00d74 mm), surface-sterilized by dipping in 70% ethanol for 10 s and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 s, and then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. Leaf pieces were then plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28 \u2103 for 3-4 days. A total of 10 isolates were recovered from the diseased leaves. The pure colonies of all fungal isolates had similar characteristics, and three isolates were randomly selected (JFRL 03-249, JFRL 03-250 and JFRL 03-251) for further study. Colonies of this fungus were gray and uneven, with a granular surface, and irregular white edges, finally turning black on PDA (Fig. 1B, C). Pycnidia were black, globose and 54-222 \u03bcm in diameter (Fig. 1D). Conidia were hyaline, single-celled, and nearly elliptical, which ranged from 7 to 13 \u00d7 5 to 7 \u03bcm (n=40) (Fig. 1E). These morphological characteristics were consistent with those described for the fungus Phyllosticta spp. (Wikee et al. 2013a). To confirm the fungal identity, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, actin (ACT), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-a), glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) genes were amplified using primers ITS5/ITS4, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, EF-728F/EF2, Gpd1-LM/Gpd2-LM and RPB2-5F2 /fRPB2-7cR, respectively (Wikee et al. 2013b). The sequences of the selected isolates were 100% identical. Hence, sequences of one representative isolate JFRL 03-250 were deposited in GenBank (OP854673, ITS; OP867004, ACT; OP867007, TEF1-a; OP867010, GPD; and OQ559562, RPB2). BLAST search analysis in GenBank showed 100% similarity with those of P. capitalensis (GenBank accession nos. ITS, MH183391; ACT, KY855662; TEF1-a, KM816635; GPD, OM640050 and RPB2, KY855820). From a phylogenetic perspective, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed by using IQtree V1.5.6 based on multiple sequences (ITS, ACT, TEF1-a, GPD and RPB2) (Nguyen et al. 2015), and the cluster analysis resulted the representative isolate JFRL 03-250 within a clade comprising Phyllosticta capitalensis (Fig. 2). Based on morphological and molecular characters, the isolate was identified as P. capitalensis. To confirm pathogenicity and fulfill Koch's postulates, 6 healthy potted plants were inoculated with 1\u00d7 106 conidia/ml suspension of isolate JFRL 03-250 by spraying on the leaves, whereas 6 plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water to serve as control. All potted plants were incubated at 28\u00b0C, 80% relative humidity and 12-h light/12-h dark alternating conditions in a climate cabinet. After 15 days, similar symptoms were observed in the inoculated leaves as in the field (Fig. 1F), whereas control leaves remained asymptomatic (Fig. 1G) and P. capitalensis was successfully re-isolated from the symptomatic leaves. Previously, P. capitalensis has been reported to cause brown leaf spot disease of various host plants around the world (Wikee et al. 2013b). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of brown leaf spot caused by P. capitalensis on D. odora in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhi Min AvenueNanchangNanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330045."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, Zhi Min Avenue, Zhi Min Avenue, China; cycui@jxau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Chaoyu", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, Jiangxi Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Fungal Resources, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; 1459507544@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhi Min AvenueNanchangNanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330045."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, Zhi Min Avenue, Zhi Min Avenue, China; fulve1204819952@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Yusen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital, 159384, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; chunxiyang@139.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chunxi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China; 2369675702@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Guanghua", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37311225", "10.1094/PDIS-11-22-2722-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
