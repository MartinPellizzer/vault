After removal of various lengths of the root tip a gravistimulus was continuously given to the root. The statistical analysis of data showed that recovery of the gravitropic response was gradually delayed as the length of the tips removed increased. This suggested that the columella cells of the root cap were involved in gravitropism. When the root cap was completely removed, the roots did not respond to gravistimuli for the first 15 h and began to reorient their growth direction at 20 h. At this time, the columella cells had just begun to regenerate and had immature amyloplasts which did not sufficiently form a sediment. These results suggest that other systems of perception exist in plant cells in addition to the amyloplast-based model of graviperception."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Earth Sciences, Faculty of Science, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodera", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravity Sensing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11219731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
