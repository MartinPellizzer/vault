Br. Compound 1 possessed a 6/6-6 tricyclic skeleton, while compounds 2-6 represented three rare dimerization patterns constructed by quinolizidine alkaloids. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis as well as ECD calculations. Biologically, compound 6 displayed significant anti-Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) activity compared with the positive control ningnanmycin. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited good insecticidal activity against Aphis fabae with LC<sub>50</sub> value of 25.2\u00a0mg/L."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
