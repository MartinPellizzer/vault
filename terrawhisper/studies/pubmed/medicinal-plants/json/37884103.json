However, the lack of knowledge regarding the chloroplast genome of N. bracteata has imposed current limitations on our study. Here, we used Next-generation sequencing to obtain the chloroplast genome of N. bracteata. The findings suggested that the 151,588\u00a0bp cp genome of N. bracteata comprises 130 genes, including 35 tRNA genes and 87 protein-coding genes. And its chloroplast genome exhibits a typical quadripartite structure, the largest single copy (LSC; 82,819\u00a0bp) and the smallest single copy (SSC; 17,557\u00a0bp) separate a pair of inverted repeats IR regions (IRa and IRb; 25,606\u00a0bp) from one another. Interestingly, palindromic repeats are more common, as shown by the examination of repetition. In the interim, 18 SSRs were discovered in the interim, the bulk of which were Adenine-Thymine (A-T) mononucleotides. Meanwhile, we compared it with five other species from the Nepeta genus. Five hypervariable areas were found by the study, including ndhH-rps15, accD-psal, ndhG-ndhl, trnH-GUG-psbA, and rpoC1-rpoB. Furthermore, the phylogenetic study revealed that N. bracteata and Nepeta stewartiana (N. stewartiana) were linked to each other most closely. In summary, our findings enrich the resources available for chloroplast genomes in the Nepeta genus. Moreover, these hypervariable regions have the potential to be developed into molecular markers, enabling the rapid identification of species within the Nepeta genus. Comparative analysis of species within the Nepeta genus can help enhance our study of their phylogenetic relationships, potential medicinal properties and bioprospecting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
