The purification procedure includes affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and gel filtration. The nuclease exhibits its activity at neutral pH and does not have an absolute requirement for a divalent cation. The purified nuclease also possesses a 3'-nucleotidase activity and is a glycoprotein containing about 20% carbohydrate. On native polyacrylamide gels the nuclease activity comigrates with the nucleotidase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of two subunits in the native enzyme. The nuclease and nucleotidase activities show differential rates of thermal inactivation, the latter following simple first order kinetics and the former exhibiting a more complex reaction. The nucleotidase was also found to be stimulated by DNA, the increase being greater with native DNA than with denatured DNA. These properties are possibly accounted for by the dimeric structure of the enzyme where the nucleotidase catalytic site resides in one subunit while the nuclease site is formed by interaction of both subunits. The enzyme also hydrolyzes double-stranded alkylated DNA and depurinated DNA at a higher rate than native DNA. Experimental evidence suggests that depurinated DNA is hydrolyzed in the region of apurinic sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Naseem", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hadi", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Endonucleases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.30.-", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA single-stranded nuclease (pea seed)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3036008", "10.1016/0003-9861(87)90412-7", "0003-9861(87)90412-7"]}}]}
