The results showed that there is a variation of inhibition. Complete inhibition was seen with a concentration 10 mg/cm3 for 48 hrs. During the 96 hr. Period, 81% inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 0.3125mg /cm3 , and 75% at a concentration of 0.15625mg/cm3. A variety of interaction was observed in combination of violet and rue. Significant synergism was achieved at a concentration of 20 mg/cm3, and a suggestive synergism was achieved with 10 mg /cm3 In addition, partial antagonism occurred at a concentration of 0.15625mg /cm3 and an antagonism at 0.3125mg /cm3 was achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic science, College of Nursing ,University of Mosul, Iraq."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al-Heali", "ForeName": "Farah M G", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahemo", "ForeName": "Zohair", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turkiye Parazitol Derg", "NlmUniqueID": "9425544", "ISSNLinking": "1300-6320"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Antagonism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ruta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trichomonas vaginalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Viola"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17309025"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
