Majority of the antipyretic drugs are synthetic in nature which exerts side effects such as gastric ulcer, hepatic necrosis and renal damage. The antipyretic potential of the hydro-alcoholic extracts of Achillea millefolium, Taraxacum officinale, Salix alba and Trigonella foenum were investigated on the yeast-induced pyrexia in albino rats. Paracetamol was used as a positive control. Rectal temperature of albino rats was verified immediately before the administration of the extracts or vehicle or paracetamol and yet again at 1-hour gap for 6 hours using a digital thermometer. The animals having pyrexia were divided into four groups Group1: Paracetamol was given to positive control. Group 2: Distilled water was given to negative control. Group 3: (250mg/kg) extract of the plant was given to rats (treatment group 1). Group 4: (500mg/kg) extracts of the plant was given to albino rats (Treatment group 2). The extracts were also phytochemically screened for alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides and phenols. The hydro-alcoholic extracts of plants with the dose of 500mg/kg showed significant (p<0.0001) decrease in yeast-induced pyrexia, as compared with that of set drug paracetamol (150mg/kg) where the extract dose 250mg/kg was less effective than that of standard drug (p<0.05). Phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins and phenols. This study showed that hydro-alcoholic extracts of all plants under study at a dose of 500mg/kg have significant antipyretic potential in yeast-induced elevated temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ajaz", "ForeName": "Mahvish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan / Department of Eastern Medicine, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asif", "ForeName": "Hafiz Muhammad", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Abid", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Muhammad Ali", "Initials": "SMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Allied Health Professionals, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tahir", "ForeName": "Imtiaz Mahmood", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Daniyal", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Fahad Said", "Initials": "FS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Achillea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antipyretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salix"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taraxacum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081770"]}}]}
