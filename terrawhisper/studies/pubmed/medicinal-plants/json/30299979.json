Insects in the order Psocoptera may cause loss of quality in such dried foods, and because of their small size, these insects can be easily transported by commerce. No information is available on how these insects may be entering Brazil via the importation of dehydrated products or how they may be exported with the increase of Brazilian dried food production. To examine these issues, 10 sites offering foods sold in bulk within the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, were chosen. At each food site, the same 20 species of aromatic spice and medicinal dehydrated plants were purchased. In the laboratory, they were analyzed for the presence of insects immediately after acquisition. After removal of nymphal and adult psocopterans, the plants were kept in vials under environmental conditions to be investigated 40 days later. Psocopterans were found in 12 of the 20 dehydrated plant species. Eleven psocopteran species were recorded, including six species of unidentified Liposcelis. Liposcelis bostrychophila (Badonnel) was found in all samples with the presence of insects. The other frequent species were Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) and Lepinotus reticulatus (Enderlein). Lepinotus reticulatus constitutes the first record in Brazil. In total, 1,021 insects were recorded in the evaluation right after purchase, and this number grew to 3,734 individuals recovered 40 days later under laboratory conditions. The data show that in a relatively short period of storage, a population increase occurs that may cause loss of product quality and a decrease in organoleptic properties. Thus, it is necessary to have greater surveillance of the products so that consumers have access to quality dehydrated foods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Instituto Biol\u00f3gico, Unidade Laboratorial de Refer\u00eancia em Pragas Urbanas, Av.
