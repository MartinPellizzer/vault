Taking into consideration the data of cluster analysis of symptomatology before the therapy, 2 groups of patients were selected: with hyposthenic (15 patients) and hypersthenic (10 patients) variations of the disease. The main symptom complex in both groups was an asthenic one, but symptomatology in group 1 tended to hyporeactivity and depressive range of affective spectrum, while in group 2--to hyperreactivity, hyperesthesia, irritation, anxious range of disorders. Pronounced improvement was observed in 18 cases, moderate effect--in 4 patients; in 3 cases the treatment was discontinued because of side-effects (headache, allergic reactions, etc). In group 1 efficiency of the treatment was higher and stable positive dynamics of the state was found, while in group 2 there was uneven reduction of the symptoms with partial temporary change (the exacerbation of anxious symptoms). The data obtained support correctness of the division of neurasthenia into hyposthenic and hypersthenic variations and expediency of taking into consideration such differences in therapeutic policy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krasnov", "ForeName": "V N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vel'tishev", "ForeName": "D Iu", "Initials": "DIu"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Nevrasteniia kak variant astenicheskogo sindroma: farmakoterapevticheski\u012d analiz na modeli terapii tanakanom."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova", "NlmUniqueID": "9712194", "ISSNLinking": "1997-7298"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthenia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurasthenia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychopathology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10441850"]}}]}
