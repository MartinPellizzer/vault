However, its cardiac protection effects and the underlying mechanism are still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect and mechanism of oxymatrine on cardiac fibrosis induced by TGF-\u03b21. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated and purified from neonatal rats. Immunocytochemical staining was used to identify the cells. MTT assay and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess cardiac fibroblasts proliferation and myofibroblasts transformation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate morphological changes of cardiac fibroblasts. The secretion of type I and III collagen was assessed by staining with picrosirius red and the hydroxyproline content was determined by colorimetric assay. Cardiac fibroblast migration was examined by scratch assay and DNA content was detected to analyze cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expressions of Notch pathway-associated protein in cardiac fibroblasts. RESULTS Oxymatrine and Notch signaling pathway inhibitor DAPT could attenuated TGF-\u03b21 induced the capacity of proliferation and migration increased in cardiac fibroblasts, as well as the secretion of collagen and hydroxyproline colorimetric content in medium. TGF-\u03b21 induced the biomarker \u03b1-SMA of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT), which was inhibited by oxymatrine and DAPT. Western blotting confirmed that oxymatrine blocked the activation of Notch induced by TGF-\u03b21. CONCLUSIONS Oxymatrine is a potential inhibitor FMT induced by TGF-\u03b21, which is at least in part mediated via inhibition of Notch signaling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
