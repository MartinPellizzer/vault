So far, one extract component, the mistletoe lectin (ML)-1, was propagated by some researchers to be the only relevant substance within the extracts. However, immunological activities of other extract components such as polysaccharides, vesicles, chitin-binding lectin and their interactions discussed in the first part, underline the significance of the other components as well. In the second part, clinical evidence for the beneficial effects of subcutaneous and intratumoral application of mistletoe therapy was presented by different working groups. However, further research is of great importance to carefully analyse and characterize the involved molecules and exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects reported in this meeting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krebsforschung Herdecke, Dept of Applied Immunology, Communal Hospital, Germany. stein.g@metronet.de"}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schietzel", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcssing", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Congress"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8102988", "ISSNLinking": "0250-7005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9858890"]}}]}
