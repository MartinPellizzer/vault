Recent research has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces macrophage autophagy to improve abnormal lipid metabolism and inflammatory environment. Especially in macrophage-derived foam cells, which has become a potential strategy for the treatment of AS. In this study, we prepared the conjugate (DB) of dextran (DEX) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The DB was used as the emulsifier to prepare nanoemulsion loaded with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) (UCNPs-Ce6@DB). The DEX modified on the surface of the nanoemulsion can recognise and bind to the scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) highly expressed on macrophages and promote the uptake of macrophage-derived foam cells in AS plates through SR-A-mediated endocytosis. In addition, UCNPs-Ce6@DB-mediated PDT enhanced ROS generation and induced autophagy in macrophage-derived foam cells, enhanced the expression of ABCA1, a protein closely related to cholesterol efflux, and inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, UCNPs-Ce6@DB was shown to inhibit plaque formation in mouse models of AS. In conclusion, UCNPs-Ce6@DB offers a promising treatment for AS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6003-3213"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key
