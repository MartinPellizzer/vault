By means of HPLC and TLC monitoring, a total of thirteen previously unreported seco-iridoid glucosides olivierisecoside A-M, as well as seven known seco-iridoid glycosides and one known iridoid glycoside were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by a comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis and ECD calculations. The absolute configuration of olivierisecoside D was further confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All the identified compounds were characterized as aromatic conjugated seco-iridoid glucosides, with olivierisecoside F-I representing a particularly rare subtype known as the morroniside type seco-iridoids. In vitro testing of the isolated compounds revealed their potential anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. The results showed olivieroside B and 6'-gentisoyl-8-epi-kingiside have good anti-inflammatory activities in LPS induced RAW264.7\u00a0cells. Additionally, olivierisecoside M exhibited some improvements in PA-induced L02 and HepG2 cells damage, known compound loganin showed slight hepatoprotective effect in PA-induced HepG2 cells damage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
