Elicitation is considered to be an effective strategy to enhance the secondary metabolites in plant cell and organ cultures. Secondary metabolite, signal molecules, and gene expression in adventitious roots were studied by HPLC-ESI-MS<sup>n</sup> , commercially available kits and qRT-PCR method, respectively. In the present study, with the addition of linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and Pichia pastoris, the highest concentration of metabolites was achieved by P. pastoris treatment. The contents of total flavonoids (7.16\u00a0mg/g) and polysaccharide (149.76\u00a0mg/g) peaked at 100\u00a0mg/L of P. pastoris, which increased by 3.09-fold and 3.28-fold compared with the control, respectively. However, the highest concentration of glycyrrhizic acid (0.62\u00a0mg/g) and glycyrrhetinic acid (0.29\u00a0mg/g) were obtained in 200\u00a0mg/L of P. pastoris and which were 3.89-fold and 2.42-fold more than the control group, respectively. ESI-MS<sup>n</sup> analysis indicated that licoricesaponine B2, licoricesapoine G2, licoricesaponine J2, ononin, uralenin, gancaonin C were only identified in the P. pastoris treatment group. Furthermore, P. pastoris also enhanced accumulation of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and activities of antioxidant enzymes involved in the plant defense response. In addition, the transcriptional activity of genes involved in glycyrrhizic acid biosynthesis was significantly increased under the treatment of P. pastoris. The results provided a scientific evidence for the further exploitation of G. uralensis adventitious roots and clinical medication. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provided an effective strategy to enhance metabolites by Pichia pastoris treatment in adventitious roots of G. uralensis.
