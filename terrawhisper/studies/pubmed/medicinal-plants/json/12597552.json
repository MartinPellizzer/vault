Biological activities, ranging from moderate to good degree, have been observed in 61 plants extracts. Follow up studies have been carried out in these extracts and some of them have shown moderate degree of activities at this Institute. However, none of the extracts was found to be good enough for further development. Results of the present studies, along with chemical investigations on different species of similar genera which were screened earlier, are also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Project, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226 001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulshreshtha", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajendran", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12597552"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
