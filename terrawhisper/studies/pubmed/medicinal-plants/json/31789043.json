However, a comprehensive study revealing the complex interplay among its constituent proteins at subcellular level is still lacking. To bridge this gap, in this work, a genome-scale interologous protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, TulsiPIN, is developed using 36 template plants, which consists of 13\u202f660 nodes and 327\u202f409 binary interactions. A high confidence network, hc-TulsiPIN, consisting of 7719 nodes having 95\u202f532 interactions is inferred using domain-domain interaction information along with interolog-based statistics, and its reliability is assessed using pathway enrichment, functional homogeneity, and protein colocalization of PPIs. Examination of topological features revealed that hc-TulsiPIN possesses conventional properties, like small-world, scale-free, and modular architecture. A total of 1625 vital proteins are predicted by statistically evaluating hc-TulsiPIN with two ensembles of corresponding random networks, each consisting of 10\u202f000 realizations of Erdo\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and Barab\u00e1si-Albert models. Also, numerous regulatory proteins like transcription factors, transcription regulators, and protein kinases are profiled. Using 36 guide genes participating in 9 secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, a subnetwork consisting of 171 proteins and 612 interactions was constructed, and 127 of these proteins could be successfully characterized.
