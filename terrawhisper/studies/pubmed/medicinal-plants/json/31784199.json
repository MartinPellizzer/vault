In this regard, Artemisia and its active phytochemicals have been introduced as having antimalarial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agents. In the case of cancer treatment, the plant species and its bioactive compounds target multiple pathways. Here we reviewed the scientific literature published up until 2018, which have explained the cytotoxic activity of the Artemisia species and their constituents. This review summarizes the published data found in PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus. Here, studies about the cytotoxicity and antitumor action on cancer cells and tumor bearing animals are discussed. Also, detailed molecular pathways affected by the plant and the phytochemistry of the cytotoxic active components are presented. Among all species and chemical constituents, the active ones have been selected and discussed in detail. The cytotoxic comparison made here may open a window for future works and selection of agents for cancer chemotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
