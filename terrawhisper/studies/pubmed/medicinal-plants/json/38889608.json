Most of the tested derivatives showed different degrees of \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 21.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69-92.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.54\u00a0\u03bcM, 45.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.50-126.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.33\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively) compared to the standard acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>: 427.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.56\u00a0\u03bcM, 24.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). Thereinto, 6c (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a021.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69\u00a0\u03bcM) displayed the most effective anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity and 6e presented the best anti-\u03b1-amylase activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 45.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.50\u00a0\u03bcM. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis suggested that 6c and 6e behaved as mixed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor and mixed \u03b1-amylase inhibitor, respectively. The results of circular dichroism, atomic force microscope, and molecular docking simulation exposed interaction mechanisms between two preferred compounds (6c and 6e) and their corresponding enzymes. Combined with the possible properties of reducing the elevation in postprandial blood glucose, oral activity, positive bioavailability, and low cytotoxicity of 6c and 6e, it could be concluded that the target derivatives may be able to act as lead molecules for the development of new hypoglycemic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
