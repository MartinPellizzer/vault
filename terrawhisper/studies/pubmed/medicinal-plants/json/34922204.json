Several studies have suggested that various factors like light, temperature, heavy metals etc. can regulate gene and their associated functions. However, what are the regulators of miPEP are not reported till date. In this study we have reported that light directly regulates miPEP858a accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Peptide assay in light and dark clearly showed the essential requirement of light. Along with this, we have reported that HY5 a shoot-to-root mobile, light-mediated transcription factor plays a crucial role in the function of miPEP858a. The transcript and endogenous protein accumulation of miPEP858a in hy5-215, OXHY5/hy5, and cop1-4 suggested that the HY5 positively regulates miPEP858a. In addition to that this study also include grafting assay between shoot of different mutant and transgenic lines with root of miPEP858a promoter:reporter lines and promoter deletion construct experiment clearly suggested that HY5 a transcription factor regulates light-dependent expression and accumulation of miPEP858a."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
