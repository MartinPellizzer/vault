EIs in pharmaceuticals may arise from numerous sources of which the herbal ingredients are not a frequent subject of pharmaceutical analyses. However, based on number of traditional use registrations per year for herbal medicinal products (HMPs) in the EU, it can be stated that monocomponent HMPs are still very popular for use. Due to the high frequency of use, exposure to EIs from HMPs may be high during long-term use. The aim of our article was Ni and Cr impurities profiling of Valeriana officinalis L., radix (Valerian root) as an example of the HMP available in Polish pharmacies for the relief of mild nervous tension and sleep disorders. The choice of metals was justified by: (1) a single dose of Ni administered via oral route can induce dermatitis in nickel-sensitised individuals; (2) Cr is a very problematic element from toxicological point of view. Our results indicate that the standards of the ICH Q3D guideline are met for all EIs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
