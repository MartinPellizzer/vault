The metabolite profiling by GC-QTOF-MS analysis identified 37 metabolites among which sucrose, malic acid, and turanose were the most abundant. A total of 18 polyphenols and 17 amino acids were identified by the HPLC-DAD analysis. The most abundant polyphenols in T. populnea were gallic acid, catechin, and myricetin. Other polyphenols like protocatechuic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, rosmarinic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, and naringenine were also detected in ample amounts. The leaf extract demonstrated higher antioxidant as well as lipid peroxidation inhibition activities. A correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the antioxidant capacity and the phenolic compounds viz. gallic acid, catechin, myricetin, quercetin, apigenin, cinnamic acid, and coumarin which indicates that these phenolic compounds are the main contributors of the antioxidant potential of T. populnea. The results of this study establish T. populnea as a potential source of nonconventional functional food. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The data presented here indicate that T. populnea can be considered as a nonconventional functional food and potential source of energy, antioxidants, minerals, essential amino acids, and bioactive compounds in herbal formulations, food supplements, or nutraceuticals. The metabolites identified from this halophyte have pharmacological and nutraceutical potentials, suggesting T. populnea as an ideal candidate for application in the food and phytopharmaceutical industries to produce health-promoting products, functional foods, and herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology & Phycology, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Bhavnagar, India."}], "LastName": "Rangani", "ForeName": "Jaykumar", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology & Phycology, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Bhavnagar, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Asha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology & Phycology, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Bhavnagar, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical and Environmental Science Division and Centralized Instrument Facility, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India."}], "LastName": "Brahmbhatt", "ForeName": "Harshad", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3499-6240"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology & Phycology, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Bhavnagar, India."}], "LastName": "Parida", "ForeName": "Asish Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Malvaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31353641", "10.1111/jfbc.12731"]}}]}
