In ancient days, such uses came into vogue due to accidental experimentation or observation which subsequently gave rise to practice either by a qualified physician or by an astrologer or by lay men, called nostrum or folk-lore. All these have their own distinct manner of use though they are very often intermingled. Apart from classical uses as mentioned in Ayurvedic, Unani or Sidha therapeutic treatises, material medica, texts on / pharmacy etc.; the new dimension of collecting additional information started in early part of 20(th) century where on several botanists contributed a lot for exploration of the same.Since Orissa is a treasure of folk-core claims and besides qualified practitioners, certain lay men especially in rural area and tribal area, saints and priests at different places also possess knowledge on certain typical uses of several plants, there is a larger scope to highlight the same for future study from difference angles. In this paper an attempt has been made to highlight certain newer information's on certain common and uncommon plants like Lygodium flexuosum, Vitex peduncularis, Barleria lupulina, Leptadenia reticulate, Selaginella indica, etc., collected from different parts of Orissa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hota", "ForeName": "N P", "Initials": "NP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padhi", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557106", "PMC3330951"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
