However, the characterization of the chemical profiles of TCM prescriptions (TCMPs) which often consist of multiple herbal medicines and contain diverse structural types, presents several challenges, such as component overlapping and time-consuming. In this study, a novel strategy known as the multi-module structure labelled molecular network (MSLMN), which integrates molecular networking, database annotation, and cluster analysis techniques, has been successfully proposed, which facilitates the identification of chemical constituents by leveraging a high-structural similarity ion list derived from the MSLMN. It has been effectively applied to analyze the chemical profile of Xiaoyao San (XYS), a classical TCMP. Through the MSLMN method, a total of 302 chemical constituents were identified, covering nine structural types in XYS. Furthermore, a validated and quantitative analytical method using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS technology was developed for 31 identified chemicals, encompassing all eight herbal medicines present in XYS, and the developed analytical approach was applied to investigate the content distribution across 40 different batches of commercially available XYS. In total, the proposed strategy has practical significance for improving the insight into the chemical profile of XYS and serves as a valuable approach for handling complex system data based on UHPLC-MS, particularly for TCMPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
