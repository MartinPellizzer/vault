Group II was given single dose (180 mg/kg) of arsenic kushta for 2 weeks. Group III received 150 mg/kg of arsenic kushta for 12 weeks; whereas, group IV was also given 150 mg/kg of arsenic kushta for 12 weeks along with 75 mg of BSA (bovine serum albumin). Histopathological changes in glomeruli, tubules and interstitium were noted in the kidney.", "Mesangial proliferation, thickening of basement membrane, necrosis, and interstitial edema were mainly observed in all the above groups except group I which served as control.
