It is the only way to revitalize the TCM industry. But in the process of it, we are facing various challenges: heavy metal contamination, low content of active ingredients, less innovation, the contradiction between resource utilization and protection, and so on. How to apply new technology and new theory of life science to solve these problems becomes an urgent matter. In recent years, the studies found that endophytic fungi played an irreplaceable positive role in the growth and development of herbal medicine, and had great impact on the quality of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore this paper introduces the effect of endophytic fungi on genuine traditional Chinese medicines, cultivation of TCM, development and protection of TCM, et al, and explores its applicative prospect, providing new idea and new power for promoting the development of modernization of TCM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shun-Xing", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28845632", "10.4268/cjcmm20160103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
