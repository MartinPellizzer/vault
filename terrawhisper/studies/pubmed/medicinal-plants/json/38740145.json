However, the taxonomy and phylogeny of Morus, especially for the Asian species, remains challenging due to its wide geographical distribution, morphological plasticity, and interspecific hybridization. To better understand the evolutionary history of Morus, we combined plastomes and a large-scale nuclear gene analyses to investigate their phylogenetic relationships. We assembled the plastomes and screened 211 single-copy nuclear genes from 13 Morus species and related taxa. The plastomes of Morus species were relatively conserved in terms of genome size, gene content, synteny, IR boundary and codon usage. Using nuclear data, our results elucidated identical topologies based on coalescent and concatenation methods. The genus Morus was supported as monophyletic, with M. notabilis as the first diverging lineage and the two North American Morus species, M. microphylla and M. rubra, as sister to the other Asian species. In the Asian Morus species, interspecific relationships were completely resolved. However, cyto-nuclear discordances and gene tree-species tree conflicts were detected in the phylogenies of Morus, with multiple evidences supporting hybridization/introgression as the main cause of discordances between nuclear and plastid phylogenies, while gene tree-species tree conflicts were mainly caused by ILS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
