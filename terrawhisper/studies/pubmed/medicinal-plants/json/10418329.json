HPLC analysis showed that the commercial botanical and wild samples of P. radix all contained platycodins and a total of twelve peaks were identified by co-HPLC anlaysis with authentic samples isolated earlier from this laboratory. The peak purity and identify were checked with a PDA. The contents of the major saponins, platycodins A, C, D were determined and the peak-area ratios of platycodins A, C, D were shown to be correlated with their sources of origin. The commercial samples from China and Korea each gave a distinct HPLC pattern with peak-area ratio of platycodins A, C, D at 1:2:3 and 2:4:1, respectively. HPLC analysis showed that those on the Japanese market were either imported from China or Korea based upon their HPLC patterns while the Japanese botanical garden or wild type samples gave a higher total saponin content with the peak-area ratio of platycodins A, C, D at 1:2:1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, Chiba, Japan. nikaido@Phar.toho-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saeki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nikaido", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10418329", "10.1055/s-1999-14021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
