For hind-limb ischemia study, treatment outcomes were assessed by evaluating hind-limb blood flow, functional limb recovery, muscle histology and angiogenesis.", "Our results demonstrated positive dose-dependent vasodilatory response to DG via an endothelium-independent mechanism that involved inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We also demonstrated significant improvement in blood perfusion and micro-vessel density in the ischemic limb and positive effects in functional limb recovery.", "In conclusion, our study supported the potential use of DG as a novel treatment for symptomatic PAD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
