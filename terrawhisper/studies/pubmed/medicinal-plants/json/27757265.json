Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenylpropanoid widely distributed in plants and well known as therapeutic and cosmetic agent. Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) which is resistant to all kinds of \u03b2-lactams, threatens even most potent antibiotics. To improve the efficiency of antibiotics against multi-drug resistant bacteria and to reduce the antibiotic dose, the antibacterial activity and the synergistic effect of RA with standard antibiotics against <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA was investigated.", "Antibacterial activity of RA against <i>S. aureus</i> and a clinical isolate of MRSA was evaluated by agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of RA was determined by broth dilution method. Synergism of RA with various antibiotics against <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA was studied by broth checkerboard method and time-kill kinetic assay. Effect of RA on microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM's) of <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA was studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.", "MIC of RA was found to be 0.8 and 10 mg/ml against <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA, respectively. RA was synergistic with vancomycin, ofloxacin, and amoxicillin against <i>S. aureus</i> and only with vancomycin against MRSA. The time-kill analysis revealed that synergistic combinations were a more effective than individual antibiotics. MSCRAMM's protein expression of <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA was markedly suppressed by RA + vancomycin combination rather than RA alone.", "The synergistic effects of RA with antibiotics were observed against <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA. RA showed inhibitory effect on the surface proteins MSCRAMM's. Even though RA was shown to exhibit a synergistic effect with antibiotics, the MIC was found to be higher. Thus, further studies on increasing the efficacy of RA can develop it as an adjuvant for antibiotics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Ekambaram", "ForeName": "Sanmuga Priya", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Perumal", "ForeName": "Senthamil Selvan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Balakrishnan", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Marappan", "ForeName": "Nathiya", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Gajendran", "ForeName": "Sabari Srinivasan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Viswanathan", "ForeName": "Vinodhini", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Intercult Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101653911", "ISSNLinking": "2146-8397"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of Interest: None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Levy SB.
