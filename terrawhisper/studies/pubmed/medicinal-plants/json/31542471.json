Phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins constitute the main phytochemicals of these plants. Preclinical pharmacological evaluations have demonstrated several biological activities for Tamarix spp. including antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, wound healing, and anti-inflammatory; however, no clinical evidence have yet been provided to support the health benefits of these plants.", "Tamarix spp. are plants rich in polyphenolic compounds with valuable medicinal properties; though, there are several methodological problems such as lack of a mechanistic approach and taxonomic ambiguities in the current available data. High-quality preclinical studies, as well as well-designed clinical trials are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these plants in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
