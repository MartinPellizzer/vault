It is characterized by progressive loss of hyaline cartilage followed by subchondral bone remodeling and inflammaging. To counteract the inflammation, synovium releases various inflammatory and immune mediators along with metabolic intermediates, which further worsens the condition. However, even after recognizing the key molecular and cellular factors involved in the progression of OA, only disease-modifying therapies are available such as oral and topical NSAIDs, opioids, SNRIs, <i>etc.</i>, providing symptomatic treatment and functional improvement instead of suppressing OA progression. Long-term use of these therapies leads to various life-threatening complications. Interestingly, mother nature has numerous medicinal plants containing active phytochemicals that can act on various targets involved in the development and progression of OA. Phytochemicals have been used for millennia in traditional medicine and are promising alternatives to conventional drugs with a lower rate of adverse events and efficiency frequently comparable to synthetic molecules. Nevertheless, their mechanism of action in many cases is elusive and uncertain. Even though many in vitro and in vivo studies show promising results, clinical evidence is scarce. Studies suggest that the presence of carbonyl group in the 2<sup>nd</sup> position, chloro in the 6<sup>th</sup> and an electron- withdrawing group at the 7<sup>th</sup> position exhibit enhanced COX-2 inhibition activity in OA. On the other hand, the presence of a double bond at the C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> position of C ring in flavonoids plays an important role in Nrf<sub>2</sub> activation. Moreover, with the advancements in the understanding of OA progression, SARs (structure-activity relationships) of phytochemicals and integration with nanotechnology have provided great opportunities for developing phytopharmaceuticals. Therefore, in the present review, we have discussed various promising phytomolecules, SAR as well as their nano-based delivery systems for the treatment of OA to motivate the future investigation of phytochemical-based drug therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Mourya", "ForeName": "Atul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Shubhra"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Bathinda, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Bajwa", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Bathinda, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Baldi", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Science, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Kamalinder K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Manisha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Shashi Bala", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Madan", "ForeName": "Jitender", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35546778", "10.2174/1389557522666220511140527", "MRMC-EPUB-123376"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
