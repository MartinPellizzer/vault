Field plants often exhibit symptoms typical of virus infection, including interveinal chlorosis, leaf cupping, distortion, and stunting. Using an herbaceous host range, at least 1 mechanically transmissible virus was detected in each of 10 accessions. All virus isolates tested reacted to potyvirus group antiserum in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results of monoclonal antibody testing using antigen coated plate (ACP) ELISA, where virions are disrupted to expose cryptotopes, indicated that isolate Tt 4 has epitopes in common with maize dwarf mosaic potyvirus A (MDMV-A). Polyclonal antiserum produced to purified preparations of the Tt 4 isolate reacted in indirect ELISA to Tt 4, the common strain of potato potyvirus Y (PVY-C), less strongly to tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) and potato potyvirus A (PVA), but not to 11 other potyviruses, including MDMV-A. Conversely, the Tt 4 isolate reacted strongly in indirect ELISA to antisera to bean common mosaic potyvirus (BCMV) and watermelon mosaic potyvirus 2 (WMV-2), but not antisera to 12 other potyviruses. Our data suggest that isolate Tt 4 is a distinct potyvirus closely related to and sharing external epitopes with PVY-C, TEV, PVA, WMV-2, and BCMV, and buried epitopes with MDMV-A. The virus has been tentatively named Tropaeolum mosaic potyvirus (TropMV). A survey of T. tuberosum in Ecuador revealed that TropMV was widespread, being detected by ACP-ELISA in 34 of 46 accessions at the National Institute for Agricultural Research's Santa Catalina Research Station, Quito, and all eight production fields surveyed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, College of Agricultural Sciences, Delaware Agricultural Experiment Station, University of Delaware, Newark, 19717."}], "LastName": "Soria", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMDE Corp., Ambato, Ecuador."}], "LastName": "Vega", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foreign Disease and Weed Laboratory, USDA-ARS Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD."}], "LastName": "Damsteegt", "ForeName": "V D", "Initials": "VD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD."}], "LastName": "McDaniel", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware."}], "LastName": "Kitto", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware."}], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30857072", "10.1094/PDIS.1998.82.1.69"]}}]}
