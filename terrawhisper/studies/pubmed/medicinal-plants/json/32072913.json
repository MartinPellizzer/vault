SYR (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) was orally administered for 6 weeks. SYR effects on factors, such as antioxidant activities and mRNA expression level of mitochondrial biogenesis indexes, were evaluated.", "In SYR-treated rats, blood glucose and ALP level were significantly reduced. SYR increased kidney GSH content in the diabetic group. Elevated renal catalase and superoxide dismutase activities in diabetic rats were restored to normal levels after treatment. SYR significantly reduced the renal TBARS level, which had increased in diabetic rats. This compound also significantly upregulated renal mRNA expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and NRF-1, and increased mtDNA/nDNA ratio in diabetic rats. These values were reduced in the non-treated diabetic group. The results show improvement of histopathological damages of kidney in the SYR treated group in comparison with the diabetic group.", "According to the results, SYR alters renal antioxidant defense mechanisms. Also, it could be considered as a novel approach by targeting mitochondria in renal diabetic complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashedinia", "ForeName": "Marzieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khoshnoud", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fahlyan", "ForeName": "Bahman Khalvati", "Initials": "BK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Burn and Wound Healing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Seyedeh-Sara", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alimohammadi", "ForeName": "Mahshid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabahi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E390O181H5", "NameOfSubstance": "syringic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organelle Biogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32072913", "10.2174/1570163817666200211101228", "CDDT-EPUB-104372"]}}]}
