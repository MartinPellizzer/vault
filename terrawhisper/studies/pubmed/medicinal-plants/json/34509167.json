Many pathways are involved in the development of HCC and various proteins including mTOR and HDACs have been identified as potential drug targets for HCC treatment. In the present study, two series of novel hybrid molecules targeting mTOR and HDACs were designed and synthesized based on parent inhibitors (MLN0128 and PP121 for mTOR, SAHA for HDACs) by using a fusion-type molecular hybridization strategy. In\u00a0vitro antiproliferative assays demonstrated that these novel hybrids with suitable linker lengths exhibited broad cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, with significant activity against HepG2 cells. Notably, DI06, an MLN0128-based hybrid, exhibited antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.61\u00a0\u03bcM, which was comparable to those of both parent drugs (MLN0128, IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.13\u00a0\u03bcM and SAHA, IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.26\u00a0\u03bcM). In\u00a0vitro enzyme inhibition assays indicated that DI06, DI07 and DI17 (PP121-based hybrid) exhibited nanomolar inhibitory activity against mTOR kinase and HDACs (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HADC6 and HADC8). Cellular studies and western blot analyses uncovered that in HepG2 cells, DI06 and DI17 induced cell apoptosis by targeting mTOR and HDACs, blocked the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and suppressed cell migration. The potential binding modes of the hybrids (DI06 and DI17) with mTOR and HDACs were investigated by molecular docking. DI06 displayed better stability in rat liver microsomes than DI07 and DI17. Collectively, DI06 as a novel mTOR and HDACs inhibitor presented here warrants further investigation as a potential treatment of HCC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
