Based on the previous work, the transcriptome of G. lhassica, an original plant of Tibetan herb &quot;Jieji Nabao&quot;, was sequenced and analyzed in this study, and the transcriptome databases of roots, stems, leaves, and flowers were constructed so as to explore unigenes that may encode the key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of iridoids. Then, qRT-PCR was used to validate the relative expression levels of 11 genes named AACT, DXS, MCS, HDS, IDI, GPPS, GES, G10H, 7-DLNGT, 7-DLGT, and SLS in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. Also, the total contents of gentiopicroside and loganic acid were determined by HPLC, respectively. The results are as follows:(1)a total of 76 486 unigenes with an average length of 852 bp were obtained;(2)335 unigenes were involved in 19 stan-dard secondary metabolism pathways in KEGG database, with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis having the maximum number(75 unigenes), and no isoflavone biosynthetic pathway was annotated;(3)171 unigenes participatedin 27 key enzymes encoding in the biosynthetic pathway of iridoids, and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase(DXR) gene was highly expressed;(4)qRT-PCR results were approximately consistent with RNA-Seq data and the relative expression levels of the 11 genes were higher in the aboveground parts(stem, leaf, and flower) than in the underground part(root);(5)the total contents of gentiopicroside and loganic acid were higher in the aboveground parts(stem, leaf, and flower) than in the underground part(root), and the difference was significant. This study provides basic scientific data for accurate species identification, evaluation of germplasm resources, research on secondary pro-duct accumulation of medicinal plants within Gentianaceae, and protection of endangered alpine species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Li", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Liang-Hong", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shu-Juan", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tibetan Traditional Medical College Lhasa 850000, China Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tong-Hua", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gentiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581079", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210610.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
