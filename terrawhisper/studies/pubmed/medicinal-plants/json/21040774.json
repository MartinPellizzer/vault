In this study we evaluated the effect of Satureja montana hydroalcoholic extract on copulatory behavior of sexually potent male rats.", "The extract was orally administered acutely or repetitively for 8 consecutive days at the doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg. The main parameters of sexual behavior, mount (ML), intromission (IL), ejaculation (EL) latencies and post-ejaculatory interval (PEI), were evaluated in animals submitted to mating test and multiple ejaculations test. Testosterone serum levels were measured in rats acutely treated with Satureja montana extract dosed at 50 mg/kg. In addition the open field test was conducted to evaluate the locomotor behavior.", "When acutely administered at both dosages, the extract was able to significantly increase EL and decrease intromission frequency (IF) in comparison with controls. The significant increase in EL was found also when the extract was subacutely administered, daily for 8 consecutive days, at the dose of 25 mg/kg. In the multiple ejaculations test, EL values of treated rats were significantly increased during the 1st and 2nd sequence in comparison with controls; in addition only rats treated with the extract were able to reach the 4th ejaculation within 30 min. Testosterone serum level measured in rats acutely treated with Satureja montana at the dose of 50 mg/kg was significantly increased in rats in comparison with controls. Finally, the locomotor activity recorded in the open field test was not affected by the acute administration of the plant extract.", "These data suggest that Satureja montana could be considered as a natural remedy for the treatment of premature ejaculation delaying ejaculation latency without exerting any negative effect on the other parameters of sexual behavior and without exerting a sedative effect. In addition the increased serum level of testosterone confirms the positive influence of Satureja montana on male sexual function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
