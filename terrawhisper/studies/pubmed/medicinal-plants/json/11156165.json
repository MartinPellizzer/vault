Feeding behaviour is reviewed, and the role of Arctotheca calendula, capeweed, in determining occurrence and abundance in pastures is investigated. Mites fed more and produced more progeny on Trifolium subterraneum (subclover) than on capeweed in non-choice experiments. In pastures with mixed species three times more mites were feeding on subclover than on capeweed foliage. However, twice as many mites were found on the soil surface under pasture patches consisting mainly of capeweed than of subclover. Patches were selected on the basis of pasture height, irrespective of plant composition. Twice as many mites were found in populations under patches of tall than short pasture. The daytime relative humidity was higher in tall than short patches, and the temperature slightly lower, making tall patches a more favourable niche for these mites. Ninety per cent of H. destructor were on the soil surface, while 10% were feeding on the upper canopy of pasture. The proportion of each population that was feeding was greater on subclover than capeweed, and subclover was a more suitable food. In Australia H. destructor occurs in regions with mixed pasture species, grown in rotation with grain crops. The ability of H. destructor to utilize foliage of a range of plant species of differing suitability for food, while living mostly on the soil surface in niches favourable for survival, has enabled it to become very abundant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Entomology, Private Bag, Wembley, Western Australia. j.ridsdill-smith@ccmar.csiro.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ridsdill-Smith", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pavri", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Exp Appl Acarol", "NlmUniqueID": "8507436", "ISSNLinking": "0168-8162"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1996 Feb;22(2):369-82", "ArticleIdList": ["24227416"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11156165", "10.1023/a:1006445007337"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
