The enzymes responsible for the monoterpenol dehydrogenation and the subsequent allylic isomerization were separated and partially purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-150, and were shown to have molecular weights of approximately 66,000 and 54,000, respectively. The general properties of the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase were examined, and specificity studies indicated that a double bond adjacent to the carbinol carbon was a required structural feature of the monoterpenol substrate. General properties of the isomerase were also determined, and it was demonstrated that the double bond migration catalyzed by this enzyme involved an intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen transfer. These enzymatic transformations represent two key steps in the metabolic pathway for the conversion of the initially formed cyclic olefin, (+/-)-limonene, to (-)-menthol and related monoterpenes characteristic of peppermint. Some stereochemical features of these reactions, and of the overall biogenetic scheme, are described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kjonaas", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venkatachalam", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Croteau", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "491-05-4", "NameOfSubstance": "isopiperitenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "529-01-1", "NameOfSubstance": "isopiperitenone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD (+) and NADP (+) Dependent Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.223", "NameOfSubstance": "isopiperitenol dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Carbon Double Bond Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.3.11", "NameOfSubstance": "isopiperitenone delta-isomerase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IKR841W74D", "NameOfSubstance": "piperitenone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Carbon Double Bond Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NAD (+) and NADP (+) Dependent Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3885858", "10.1016/0003-9861(85)90139-0", "0003-9861(85)90139-0"]}}]}
