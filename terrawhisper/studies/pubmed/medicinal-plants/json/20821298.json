The roots of Astragalus membranaceus and A. membranaceus var. mongholica are commonly used as Radix Astragali in several Asian countries, including China, Japan, and Korea. However, in addition to the two species recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, there are twenty-three species from different genera including Astragalus, Oxytropis, Hedysarum, and Glycyrrhiza, which have been used as adulterants not only in trading markets but also by the herbal medicine industry. Therefore, a simple, reliable, and accurate classification method is important for distinguishing authentic Radix Astragali from its adulterants. In this study, we acquired data for 37 samples from four related genera within the family Fabaceae. Then we compared four candidate DNA barcoding markers using ITS, matK, rbcL, and coxI sequences from nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes, all commonly used for plants to identify genetic variations among genera, intraspecies, and interspecies. We observed higher divergences among genera and interspecies for ITS, which have the average Kimura 2-parameter distances of 4.5% and 14.1%, respectively, whereas matK was found to have sufficient divergence at the intraspecific level. Moreover, two indels detected in the matK sequence are useful for PCR studies in distinguishing Radix Astragali from its adulterants. This study suggests that the combined barcoding regions of ITS and matK are superior barcodes for Radix Astragali and further studies should focus on evaluating the applicability and accuracy of such combined markers for a wide range of traditional Chinese herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "HaiYan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "WeiWei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "BaoLin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Sun", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "RuiJing", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "JunLin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "SongNian", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "QiShi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sci China Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101529880", "ISSNLinking": "1674-7305"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "922OP8YUPF", "NameOfSubstance": "Huang Qi"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electronic Data Processing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20821298", "10.1007/s11427-010-4044-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
