Hence, the identification of anti-angiogenic agents with fewer common side effects would be valuable in cancer therapy. In this study, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects of a hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek seed (HAEF) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with various concentrations of HAEF and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value was estimated by using the MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and matrix metalloproteinase enzyme (MMP-2 and MMP-9) gene expression profiles were evaluated by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, MMP activities and PI3K, Akt and cyclin D1 protein expression levels were evaluated by gel zymography and Western blotting, respectively. HAEF reduced HUVEC viability, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that treatment with HAEF markedly reduced MMP-2/MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF gene expression, as compared to the control group. We also found that MMP-2/MMP-9 enzyme activity and PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 protein expression were notably decreased in cells treated with HAEF. Our results suggest that HAEF can potentially inhibit angiogenesis, and also affect cellular proliferation by targeting the PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway. Thus, fenugreek seed extract merits further investigation as a source of compounds with anti-cancer properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safarpour", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["125609"], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzavi", "ForeName": "Farshad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmani", "ForeName": "Farzad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mashkani", "ForeName": "Baratali", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Surgical Oncology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamidi Alamdari", "ForeName": "Daryoush", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Altern Lab Anim", "NlmUniqueID": "8110074", "ISSNLinking": "0261-1929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "68990-15-8", "NameOfSubstance": "fenugreek seed meal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"RegistryNumber": "136601-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin D1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin D1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37345436", "10.1177/02611929231181623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
