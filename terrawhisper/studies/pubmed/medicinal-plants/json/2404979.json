Models that attempt to explain this phenomenon involve light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (LHCII) that capture light energy and migrate between PSII and PSI. This report shows that in pea chloroplasts, the major protein component of LHCII, light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (LHCP), can indeed migrate within the thylakoid membrane. We show, however, that although newly imported LHCP inserts into both stacked and unstacked thylakoid membranes, it then moves only from the unstacked, PSI-rich membranes to the stacked, PSII-rich membranes. The observed migration is not affected by light treatment that induces a redistribution of captured light energy (state I-state II transition) that previously was thought to induce LHCP to migrate in the opposite direction, from stacked to unstacked membranes. A mutation that removes the site of LHCP phosphorylation, the proposed trigger of state transitions, also has no effect on the integration and movement of LHCP, but does render LHCP more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. These results are not consistent with current models that deal with the short-term change in the distribution of light energy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27706."}], "LastName": "Kohorn", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yakir", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligonucleotide Probes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Probes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2404979", "S0021-9258(19)39948-X"]}}]}
