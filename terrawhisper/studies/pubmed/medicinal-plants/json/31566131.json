BNNTs with similar surface morphology, alternating B and N atoms completely substitute for C atoms in a graphitic-like sheet with nearly no alterations in atomic spacing, with uniformity in dispersion in the solution, and readily applicable in biomedical applications with no obvious toxicity. Also demonstrating a good cell interaction and cell targeting.", "With a purpose of increasing the field of BNNT for drug delivery, a theoretical investigation of the interaction of Melatonin, Vitamin C, Glutathione and lipoic acid antioxidants using (9, 0) zigzag BNNTs is shown using density functional theory.", "The geometries corresponding to Melatonin, Vitamin C, Glutathione and lipoic acid and BNNT with different lengths were individually optimized with the DMOL3 program at the LDA/ DNP (fine) level of theory.", "In the presence of external electric field Melatonin, Vitamin C, Glutathione and lipoic acid could be absorbed considerably on BNNT with lengths 22 and 29 \u00c5, as the adsorption energy values in the presence of external electric field are considerably increased.", "The external electric field is an appropriate technique for adsorbing and storing antioxidants on BNNTs.
