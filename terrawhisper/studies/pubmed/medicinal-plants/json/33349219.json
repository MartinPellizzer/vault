Natural diphyllin and its glycosides were identified as potent vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors.", "The aim of this study was to design and synthesize a series of heterocyclic derivatives of diphyllin as novel anticancer agents.", "The targeted heterocyclic derivatives of diphyllin were synthesized from diphyllin employing etherification reaction and N-substitution reaction. Cytotoxicity of these compounds on four cancer cells was assessed by MTT assay. The inhibitory activity of V-ATPase of compound 3n was measured on MGC-803 cells. Anti-migration and anti-invasion abilities were assessed by transwell invasion assay and scratch wound assay.", "Most of these derivatives displayed potent cytotoxicity on four cancer cells at submicromolar concentrations. The most potent derivative 3n has been shown to inhibit V-ATPase activity, migration and invasion abilities on MGC-803 cells at 0.75 \u03bcM.", "The collective results clearly indicate that heterocyclic derivatives of diphyllin inhibit the viability, V-ATPase activity, migration and invasion of the MGC803 cells.
