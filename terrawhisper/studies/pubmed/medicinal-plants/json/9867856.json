Here we report the first molecular cloning and characterization of PGDH from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis of cDNA and a genomic clone revealed that the PGDH gene is composed of three exons, encoding a 623-amino acid polypeptide (66, 453 Da). The deduced protein, containing three of the most conserved regions in the NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, has 38-39% identity to its animal and bacterial counterparts. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence for translocation into plastids was confirmed by particle-gun bombardment experiments using green fluorescence protein as a reporter protein for subcellular localization. Southern hybridization analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping indicated that PGDH is a single-copy gene that is mapped to the upper arm of chromosome 1. Northern hybridization analysis indicated preferential expression of PGDH mRNA in root tissues of light-grown plants, suggesting that the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis plays an important role in supplying Ser to non-photosynthetic tissues. The recombinant enzyme overproduced in Escherichia coli displayed hyperbolic kinetics with respect to 3-phosphoglycerate and NAD+."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Research Center of Medicinal Resources, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Yayoi-cho 1-33, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8522, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noji", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AB003280", "AB010407"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "452VLY9402", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.95", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Complementation Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Serine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9867856", "10.1074/jbc.274.1.397", "S0021-9258(18)37098-4"]}}]}
