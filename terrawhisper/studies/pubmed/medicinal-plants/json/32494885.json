The adsorption ability of the\u00a0composites was greatly improved compared to that of pristine MSNs or MIL-101(Fe) for phytohormones (Phys). The MSN@MIL-101(Fe) composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometer, and mapping analysis. Using MSN@MIL-101(Fe) composites as sorbent, a dispersive solid-phase extraction procedure (dSPE) was developed to extract three endogenous Phys (abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-aceticacid (IAA), and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)) and two exogenous Phys (1-naphthylacetic acid (1-NAA) and 2-naphthylacetic acid (2-NAA)) prior to HPLC-DAD analysis. The experimental parameters including sample volume, sorbent amount, adsorption time, adsorption pH, desorption time, and desorption solvent on extraction efficiency were optimized and evaluated. Under optimized conditions, the working range of 0.08 to 0.45\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> with enrichment factors from 144 to 207 were achieved. The linear range is\u00a00.75-200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for IAA, 0.20-200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for ABA, and\u00a01.0-200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for IBA, 1-NAA, and 2-NAA. With MSN@MIL-101(Fe) as sorbent for extraction of Phys and determination\u00a0by HPLC-DAD, two endogenous Phys (IAA and ABA) were detected from mung bean sprouts which were made in a laboratory, and the results were further confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The composites can be applied to extract other small molecules, which have similar chemical structures with Phys in biological, environmental, and food samples.
