Diabetic rats were treated with C. colocynthis, M. charantia or C. colocynthis + M. charantia mixed extract at a dose of 250 mg /kg body weight per oral per day for 21 days. The mean body weight of all the diabetic rat groups on day 1 of treatment (day 10 of diabetes) was significantly lower than the normal control rat group (P<0.05). The blood glucose level of all the diabetic rat groups on day 1 of treatment (day 10 of diabetes) was significantly (P<0.05) higher (> 200 mg/dl) than the normal control rat group (95.5 \u00b1 2.7). At the end of treatment (day 21), the diabetic rats treated with plant extracts showed significant increase (P<0.05) in body weight and significant (P<0.05) reduction in blood glucose level when compared to diabetic control animals. Significant increase (< 0.05) was observed in the serum bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea and creatinine levels of diabetic control rat group. The serum levels of these liver and kidney-related parameters of diabetic rats treated with plant extract were significantly lower when compared to diabetic control rat group (p < 0.05). Photomicrographs of liver and kidney microsections from diabetic rats treated with these plant extracts showed amelioration in the hepato-renal histoarchitectures. It was concluded that the C. colocynthis and M. charantia methanol extracts are antidiabetic and hepato-renal protective in STZ induced diabetic male rats. Treatment of the diabetic rats with C. colocynthis + M. charantia mixed extract is more effective in the amelioration of diabetes and hepato-renal injuries in STZ induced diabetic male rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4885-3497"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Lahore, Department of Zoology, Punjab, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tehseen", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3860-2424"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Biotechnology, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Haq", "ForeName": "T U", "Initials": "TU"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4779-6707"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Zoology, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ilahi", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9274-2620"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Biotechnology, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3381-5698"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Zoology, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Attaullah", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3322-4030"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bacha Khan University, Department of Biotechnology, Charsada, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zamani", "ForeName": "G Y", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4649-0290"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Botany, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zaman", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9764-159X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Malakand, Department of Zoology, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35703627", "10.1590/1519-6984.260189", "S1519-69842024000100330"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
