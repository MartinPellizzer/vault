However, little is known about its metabolic fate and pharmacokinetic properties. This study is thus designed to investigate the metabolic fate of isochlorogenic acid A. An analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/Q-TOF MS) was established to characterize the metabolites of isochlorogenic acid A in the plasma, urine and feces of rats. A total of 32 metabolites were identified. The metabolic pathways mainly include hydrolyzation, dehydroxylation, hydrogenation and conjugation with methyl, glucuronic acid, glycine, sulfate, glutathione and cysteine. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of all the circulating metabolites were investigated. M11 resulting from hydrolyzation, dehydroxylation and hydrogenation was the dominant circulating metabolite after the intragastric administration of isochlorogenic acid A. The results obtained will be useful for further study of elucidating potential bioactive metabolites which can provide better explanation of the pharmacological and/or toxicological effects of this compound."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Guoxiu", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Yunxi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guangji", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9395-7829"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Haiping", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "178AQM8R56", "NameOfSubstance": "isochlorogenic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28052484", "10.1002/bmc.3927"]}}]}
