The effect of different residence time and concentrations on the antibacterial activity of nanoemulsion was studied by measuring the release of protein, nucleic acids, potassium, and also recording the MIC, MBC and time killing assays. Remarkable intensification was observed by employing microfluidic chip regarding a high-contact surface area between nanodroplets and bacterial membrane. The MIC and MBC values for E. coli and B. atrophaeus in conventional method were 400 and 1600\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas these values reduced to 11 to 50\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> using microfluidic system. B. atrophaeus seemed to be more resistant than E. coli to the nanoemulsion treatment, perhaps due to different cell wall structures. Bacterial cell wall changes were examined using a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) technique. It was found that the structural changes were more imminent in Gram negative E. coli by detecting a number of released lipids including phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamines. The DESI spectra of B. atrophaeus revealed no M/Z related lipid release. These findings may help providing novel nano based natural antibacterials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
