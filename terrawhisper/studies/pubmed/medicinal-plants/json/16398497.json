Biophytum sensitivum (L.) DC) is a medicinal plant having a traditional use, among others, as a wound healing remedy in Mali and other countries. As a water extract of the aerial parts of the plant is a frequently used preparation, we decided to look for a bioactive polysaccharide in this extract. One of the obtained polysaccharide fractions, BP100 III, isolated from a 100 degrees C water extract from the aerial parts of B. petersianum and having a monosaccharide composition typical for pectic substances, was shown to exhibit potent dose-dependent complement fixating activity. The BP100 III fraction was subjected to degradation by endo-alpha-d-(1-->4)-polygalacturonase, and three fractions were obtained by gel filtration. The highest molecular weight fraction, BP100 III.1, had a more potent activity in the complement test system than the native polymer, while the two lower molecular weight fractions were less active than the native polymer. The major part of BP100 III.1 consists of galacturonic acid and rhamnose, with branches being present on both the rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues. Arabinogalactan type II is also present in the polymer, indicating that BP100 III.1 has a structure typical of the hairy region of pectins. The major part of the two other fractions is a galacturonan, containing a strikingly high number of branch points, some to which xylose is attached. These results indicate that the pectic substance in B. petersianum contains both rhamnogalacturonan and xylogalacturonan regions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, P.O.
