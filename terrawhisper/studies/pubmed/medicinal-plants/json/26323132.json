For the different medicinal application of Folium Pini, varied methods were chosen to estimate weight and construct index equation. Weight adjustment based.on equal emphasis were used as economic weight determining method to select the best families, and the index (accuracy 0. 936 4 and heritability 0. 881 6) obtained was a little better than that obtained by equal emphasis, and much better than that by restricted index. The superior families selected with adjustment weight and equal emphasis were No. 46, 43 and 28. Partial regression were used as economic weight determining method to select the best families,and the index obtained had the highest accuracy (0.941 5) , index heritability (0. 889 9) and the genetic gain of shikimic acid content. The superior families selected with this method were No. 46, 27 and 47. No. 46 was the best families with maximal economic benefit. Our study indicated that suitable method for estimate weight and construct index equation can be applied for better accuracy of superior families selection of P. massoniana."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Man-xi", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Cui-qi", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Jian-ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Yong-kun", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Zun-hong", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Xiao-feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26323132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
