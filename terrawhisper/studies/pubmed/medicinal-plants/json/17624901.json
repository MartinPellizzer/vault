(Yanhuanglian) were performed for authentication purposes. Ninety samples prepared from different parts of C. saxicola, including whole plants, roots, stems, leaves and flowers, from wild and cultivated populations, were submitted to quantitative determination and fingerprint analysis. Five major alkaloids, namely, tetradehydroscoulerine, dehydroapocavidine, dehydroisoapocavidine, coptisine and dehydrocavidine, were quantitatively analysed by reversed-phase HPLC with acceptable recoveries (>98.2%). Chemical fingerprinting of C. saxicola was established and involved 11 markers. The results indicated that there were no obvious differences between the chemical profiles of wild and of cultivated C. saxicola populations, and that the mean alkaloid contents of the five marker compounds in cultivated populations were significantly higher than those of the wild plants. The highest content of total alkaloids (up to 28.8 mg/g) was found in roots of C. saxicola. The total alkaloids of the leaves were approximately 50% of those of roots, suggesting that the leaves may be employed as an alternative source of alkaloids. Chemical fingerprints and quantitative HPLC analysis will have a positive impact on the conservation and cultivation of this medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Liang", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chuan", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Run-Hui", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hai-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Biology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17624901", "10.1002/pca.994"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
