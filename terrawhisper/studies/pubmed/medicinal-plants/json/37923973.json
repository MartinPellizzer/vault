In May 2022, anthracnose symptoms were observed on leaves of S. grijsii planted in a nursery (N22\u00b055'46\u2033, E108\u00b022'11\u2033) in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China. More than 30% of leaves were infected. Initially, irregular brown spots (1 to 2 mm in diameter) formed on the leaves, with a slight depression in the center, then expanded into large, dark-brown lesions. In severe infections, lesions coalesced and covered the entire leaf, causing wilt and fall off the plant. To identify the pathogen, 30 diseased leaves were collected from five plants. Leaf tissues (5 \u00d7 5 mm) were cut from the infected margins, surface sterilized (75% ethanol 10 s, 2% NaClO 5 min, rinsed three times with sterile water), then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 28\u2103 in darkness. After 5 days, 16 fungal isolates with similar morphology were obtained from 30 plated tissues. Colonies on PDA were abundant with grayish-white fluffy mycelia, and yellowish-white on the back. Conidia were one-celled, hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical with narrowing at the center, blunt at the ends, and ranged from 11.35 to 22.14 \u00d7 4.88 to 7.67 \u03bcm (n=100). Morphological characteristics of the isolates were similar to the descriptions of Colletotrichum sp. (Prihastuti et al. 2009). Five representative isolates (Cs34, Cs31, Cs32, Cs33 and Cs35), which were preserved in the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Biology for Crop Diseases and Insect Pests, were selected for molecular identification. The ITS (Nos. OQ618199, OR539576 to OR539579), TUB2 (Nos. OQ630972, OR545076 to OR545079), ACT (Nos. OQ685919, OR545060 to OR545063), CHS-1 (Nos. OQ685917, OR545068 to OR545071), GAPDH (Nos. OQ685916, OR545072 to OR545075), and CAL (Nos. OQ685918, OR545064 to OR545067) sequences showed >99% identity to those of Colletotrichum siamense ex-type culture ICPM 18578 (Nos. JX010171, JX009924, JX009714 and JX009518) and strain C1315.2 (Nos. JX009865 and JX010404) in GenBank. Multigene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, TUB, ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, and CAL) using the Maximum likelihood method indicated that the 5 isolates were clustered with C. siamense. To perform pathogenicity tests, three one-year-old healthy S. grijsii plants were inoculated with conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/ml) of isolate Cs34 by brushing gently with a soft paintbrush, each plant was inoculated with 3 leaves. The same number of plants were inoculated with sterile water as control, and pathogenicity tests were performed three times. All plants were kept in an artificial climatic box at 28\u2103, with a 90% humidity and a 12 h light/dark cycle. Similar symptoms to those of the field were observed on all inoculated leaves after 5 days, whereas controls remained symptomless. Reisolated fungi from the diseased leaves were confirmed to be C. siamense by morphology and molecular characterization, confirming Koch's postulates. C. siamense has been reported causing anthracnose on Crinum asiaticum (Khoo et al. 2022) in Malaysia, and Erythrina crista-galli in China (Li et al. 2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose on S. grijsii in China. The results of pathogen identification provide crucial information for control strategies of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning Daxue East Road NO.174, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 78960987@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Chanjuan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 174 East University Road, Xixiangtang District, Nanning,Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530001; 1464596962@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 117866, Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China; shbojiang@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shangbo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, China; 42610255@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; 1870886377@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No.189, Changgang road, Nanning City,Guangxi, P.R.China, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530023; yeyunfeng111@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yunfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, Guangxi, China; plianfu@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Lianfu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Daxue RoadNanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; fug110@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37923973", "10.1094/PDIS-09-23-1841-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
