Here we report the first successful assignment of 15 SSR markers to the Phaseolus vulgaris molecular linkage map. A total of 37 SSR primer pairs were developed and tested for amplification and product-length polymorphism with BAT93 and Jalo EEP558, the parental lines of an F7 recombinant inbred (RI) population previously used for the construction of a common bean molecular linkage map. Sixteen of the SSRs polymorphic to the parental lines were analyzed for segregation and 15 of them were assigned to seven different linkage groups, indicating a widespread distribution throughout the bean genome. Map positions for genes coding for DNAJ-like protein, pathogenesis-related protein 3, plastid-located glutamine synthetase, endochitinase, sn-glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase, NADP-dependent malic enzyme, and protein kinase were determined for the first time. Addition of three SSR loci to linkage group B4 brought two separated smaller linkage groups together to form a larger linkage group. Analysis of allele segregation in the F7 RI population revealed that all 16 SSRs segregated in the expected 1:1 ratio. These SSR markers were stable and easy to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They should be useful markers for genetic mapping, genotype identification, and marker-assisted selection of common beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Center, Harrow, Ontario. yuk@em.agr.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poysa", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gepts", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Linkage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minisatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11218079", "10.1093/jhered/91.6.429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
