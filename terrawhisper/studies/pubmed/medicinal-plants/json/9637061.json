The extract of 1 g dry roots inhibited 9380 +/- 390 micrograms of pepsin. The main steps of the isolation procedure consisted of extraction in boiling water, precipitation at pH 3 and washing the precipitate with ethanol, column chromatography on sephadex G-75, and finally ultrafiltration on UM10 membrane. The specific activity at the last step was 44 units ml-1 solution which measured 1.0 at 287 nm (a one unit of the inhibitor is that amount which inhibited 1 microgram of pepsin under the conditions of the assay). The overall purification was 22-fold. The inhibitor did not bind CM-cellulose, but it did bind DEAE-cellulose irreversibly. A pepsin-inhibitor complex was formed with a KI = 2 x 10(-8) M. The inhibitor inhibited peptic milk-clotting activity at pH 5.3. A solution of the inhibitor exhibited split-peak spectra with two maxima at 280 nm and 287 nm. The epsilon at 287 nm was estimated at 9.4 x 10(5) l mol-1 cm-1 based on a M(r) value which was estimated at 62,500."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Abuereish", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.23.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Pepsin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Pepsin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9637061", "10.1016/s0031-9422(97)01131-x", "S003194229701131X"]}}]}
