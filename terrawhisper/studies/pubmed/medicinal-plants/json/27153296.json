The developed method was validated by testing the following parameters: linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), matrix effect, accuracy-precision and measurement uncertainty; the validation study clearly demonstrated the suitability of the method for its intended application. All pesticides showed good linearity in the range 0.01-1.0\u00a0\u03bcg mL(-1) for OCs and OPs and 0.05-2.5\u00a0\u03bcg mL(-1) for SPs with correlation coefficients higher than 0.98. The method gave good recoveries for most of the pesticides (70-120%) with intra-day and inter-day precision < 20% in most of the cases. The limits of detection varied from 0.003 to 0.03\u00a0mg kg(-1), and the LOQs were determined as 0.01-0.049\u00a0mg kg(-1). The expanded uncertainties were <30%, which was distinctively less than a maximum default value of \u00b150%. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine pesticide residues in 12 commercial market samples obtained from different locations in India."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Tripathy", "ForeName": "Vandana", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Ajoy", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pesticide Residue Laboratory, Anand Agricultural University , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dilipkumar J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Basak", "ForeName": "B B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pesticide Residue Laboratory, Anand Agricultural University , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Paresh G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Jitendra", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27153296", "10.1080/03601234.2016.1170544"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
