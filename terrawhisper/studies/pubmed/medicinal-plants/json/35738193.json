The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding dexamethasone to ketorolac on pain control in acute renal colic.", "One hundred twenty patients with renal colic were randomized into comparison and intervention groups to investigate the effect of 8 mg of dexamethasone with 30 mg ketorolac administered immediately after the patient's admission. The primary outcome was pain intensity based on the visual analog scale (VAS), which was assessed at the baseline and after 30 and 60 min of drugs treatment. Also, grade of vomiting and narcotic or antiemetic requirement were measured at the baseline and after the 60-min intervention.", "A total of 120 patients were included in the final analysis, with 60 patients (50%) randomized to the comparison group (just ketorolac) and 60 (50%) randomized to the intervention group (ketorolac + dexamethasone). There were no significant demographic differences between groups (P > 0.05 for all). Differences in VAS scores were significantly lower in the intervention group after 30 min of drug administration (P = 0.009, compared with the control). However, there was not a significant difference in the median VAS score between groups at the baseline and end of the study (P > 0.05). At the end of the study, the percent of patients who need to narcotics (35% vs. 58%, P = 0.01) and/or antiemetic (12% vs. 28%, P = 0.022) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the controls.", "In comparison with the patients who just received ketorolac, adding dexamethasone provided improved pain control after 30 min of therapy. Furthermore, it decreased opioid requirements and decreased an antiemetic need at the end of the study. Dexamethasone should be considered an important multimodal adjunct for controlling pain and nausea in renal colic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
