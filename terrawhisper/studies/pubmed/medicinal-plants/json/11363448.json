Cat's Claw is popular because of the anecdotal data that it is a strong antiviral, antioxidant, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory substance. However, the manufacturer would not supply any information that it is effective in AIDS treatment, and it was rejected. Thymopentin, which is being studied in the United States and is available commercially in Germany, was found to be effective in reducing the number of opportunistic infections in persons taking AZT, and was approved. Cantharadin was approved for treatment of Molluscum Contagiosum and will be provided to patients with a prescription for it. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a promising treatment for cryptosporidia and microsporidia, but is apparently not for sale anywhere in the United States."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": [], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "11363448", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1996", "Month": "06", "Day": "13"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Issue": "no 32", "PubDate": {"Year": "1996", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "Notes from the underground (New York, N.Y.)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Notes Undergr"}, "ArticleTitle": "New products?
