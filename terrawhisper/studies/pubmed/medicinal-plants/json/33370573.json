Among several medicinal plants with beneficial effects on health, curcumin acts as a multi-functional drug with antioxidant activity. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of curcumin against aluminum induced-oxidative stress and astrocytes death, in vitro ad in vivo. Incubation of cultured rat astrocytes with two concentrations of Al (37 \u03bcM and 150 \u03bcM) for 1 h provoked a dose-dependent reduction of the number of living cells as evaluated by Fluorescein diacetate and lactate dehydrogenase assay. Al-treated cells exhibited a reduction of both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Pretreatment of astrocytes with curcumin (81 \u03bcM) prevented Al-induced cell death. Regarding in vivo study, rats were exposed acutely during three consecutive days to three different doses of Al (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, i.p injection), together with curcumin treatment (30 mg/kg). For the chronic model, animals were exposed to Al (3 g/l) in drinking water from intrauterine age to 4 months ages, plus curcumin treatment (175 mg/kg). Data showed that both acute and chronic Al intoxication induced an obvious astrogliosis within motor cortex and hippocampus, while, such effects were restored by curcumin. We showed herein that Al was highly toxic, induced astrocytes death. Then, curcumin protected astrocytes against Al-toxicity. The cytoprotective potential of curcumin is initiated by stimulation of endogenous antioxidant system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
