Over 152 million men globally suffer from ED and by 2025, the number of affected individuals is anticipated to be around 322 million. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies such as phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, alprostadil, penile prosthesis surgery, and hormonal replacement are available for management and recuperation of ED. Nevertheless, such therapies are reported to have adverse effects as well as life-threatening. Accordingly, diversity of medicinal plant species and bioactive active compounds are preferred as therapeutic options because they are natural, abundant, available, low-cost and cause fewer or no side effects. This current review will emphasise the aetiology, risk factors, mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of ED, treatments of ED as well as their side effects. It also provides medicinal plants that are proven effective in vivo and in vitro for the mitigation and treatment of male ED. This knowledge could be used in the future in drug discovery for the development of more natural drugs with no side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
