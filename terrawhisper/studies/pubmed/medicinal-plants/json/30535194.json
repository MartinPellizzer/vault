As chemical signaling is a significant component in plant-insect interaction, the present study examined the involvement of rosemary essential oil volatiles in this differential colonization to elucidate the rosemary-whitefly ecological interaction. Thirty-two rosemary varieties with different chemical profiles were used. The average whitefly preference was 25.1% with a significant variation of 51.4%, partitioning the sampled varieties into five preference groups, hence suggesting rosemary as a non-preferred host for the insect. All relations between preference and the major volatiles 1,8-cineole, camphor, linalool, verbenone, bornyl acetate and borneol were significantly (P \u2264 0.05) or notably (0.05 < P \u2264 0.09) negative (r < 1). Therefore, revealing that whitefly preference for rosemary is based on a continuum of repellency rather than attraction. 'Choice' bioassays with a range of the major volatile concentrations and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) volatile blends (fractions) validated this observation. Principle component analysis of the entire chemical profile of two extreme varieties, representing high and low preferences, identified that approximately 43% of the volatiles in the essential oil were directly associated with repellency. Keeping in mind the remaining 57% of the compounds, this myriad of volatiles exhibit the ecological complexity of the rosemary-whitefly eco-system, explaining that whitefly preference to rosemary is repellency based."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.
