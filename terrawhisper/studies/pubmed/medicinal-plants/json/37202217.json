In Ginseng, the fungus may cause ginseng gray mold disease, causing great economic losses in the ginseng industry. Therefore, the early detection of <i>B. cinerea</i> in the process of ginseng production is necessary for the disease prevention and control of the pathogen's spread. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-nucleic acid sensor (PCR-NAS) rapid detection technique was established, and it can be used for field detection of <i>B. cinerea</i> through antipollution design and portable integration. The present study showed that the sensitivity of PCR-NAS technology is 10 times higher than that of traditional PCR-electrophoresis, and there is no need for expensive detection equipment or professional technicians. The detection results of nucleic acid sensors can be read by the naked eye in under 3 min. Meanwhile, the technique has high specificity for the detection of <i>B. cinerea</i>. The testing of 50 field samples showed that the detection results of PCR-NAS were consistent with those of the real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. The PCR-NAS technique established in this study can be used as a novel nucleic acid field detection technique, and it has a potential application in the field detection of <i>B. cinerea</i> to achieve early warning of the pathogen infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Jilin Agricultural University, Research Center Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization, Changchun 130118, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Bairu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Jilin Agricultural University, Research Center Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Huijie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Diao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Agricultural University, Laboratory for Cultivation and Breeding of Medicinal Plants of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiaxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuoyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yongzhe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Jilin Agricultural University, Research Center Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meiping", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5447-9665"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, Jilin 132101, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Jilin Agricultural University, Research Center Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization, Changchun 130118, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Agricultural University, Laboratory for Cultivation and Breeding of Medicinal Plants of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yanfang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "SupplMeshList": ["Botrytis cinerea"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Botrytis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}], "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37202217", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1839-SR"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
