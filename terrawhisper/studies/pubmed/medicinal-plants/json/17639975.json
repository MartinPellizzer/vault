Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium absorbing capacity in the stem, the leaf and the root systems was N > K > P. In the whole growth period, nitrogen accumulation reached the highest, and followed with the accumulation of potassium, and the accumulation of phosphorus was the lowest. In the last phase of the exuberant growth period, the accumulation intensity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium reduced. During the harvesting time, the accumulation intensity of nitrogen and potassium increased, and the accumulation intensity of phosphorus remained stable.", "The dry matter accumulation reached the maximum in 100-163 days after seedling emergence. The absorption strength of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in aerial part reached the maximum in 100-132 days after seeding emergence, the maximum absorption comes earlier than that of phosphorus and potassium, at that time the needs of nutrients reach the highest.
