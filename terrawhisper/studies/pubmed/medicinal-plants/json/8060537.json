The antibodies were raised in rabbits using 7- or 10-succinyl-10-deacetylbaccatin III-BSA conjugate as immunogen. The working range of the assay was from 0.003 to 1.000 ng (0.09 to 31.33 nM) of 10-deacetylbaccatin III per assay. The cross-reacting material in crude plant extract was examined by chromatographic (silica gel CC, HPLC) and immunoassay methods. Study on the evaluation of cross-reacting material in crude Taxus plant extracts showed that at least 80% of the immunosignal correspond to 10-deacetylbaccatin III in the extract. The ELISA method was applied to investigate the 10-deacetylbaccatin III equivalent content in crude extracts of 19 plants species including Taxaceae, Taxodiaceae and Pinaceae species. The 10-deacetylbaccatin III-like structure was only detected in Taxus and Torreya sp. The results indicate that this immunoassay is a useful tool for the rapid screening of species, varieties or individual plants out of a wide population. The distribution of 10-deacetylbaccatin III equivalent content in 9-month old Taxus plantlets cultivated in vitro as well as in callus culture was investigated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie et de Bromatologie, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgique."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaziri", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diallo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vanhaelen-Fastre", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhiri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vanhaelen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hom\u00e8s", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bombardelli", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler", "NlmUniqueID": "8503054", "ISSNLinking": "0177-3593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Taxoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1605-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "taxane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4K6EWW2Z45", "NameOfSubstance": "10-deacetylbaccatine III"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Succinates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taxoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8060537", "10.1515/bchm3.1994.375.4.281"]}}]}
