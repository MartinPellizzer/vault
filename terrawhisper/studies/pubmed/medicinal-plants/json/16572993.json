The combination of yeast extract and Ag+ (300 micromol x L(-1)) yielded the highest tanshinone I content, which was nearly 14-fold of the control, and the synergistic elicitation coefficient was 3.0. The combination of yeast extract and Co2+ (100 micromol L(-1)) led to the highest tanshinone IIA content, which was about 14.5-fold of the control, and the synergistic elicitation coefficient was 2.1. Only yeast extract combined with alpha-amino isobutyric acid (200 micromol x L(-1)) increased the crypotanshinone content more effectively than single elicitors. The highest crypotanshinone content was 1.28 mg x g(-1), about 30-fold of the control with a synergistic elicitation coefficient of 1.3.", "The elicitation by the combination of a biotic elicitor and an abiotic elicitor can generate a synergistic effect, which is more effective than single elicitors to promote secondary metabolite production in plant tissue cultures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zong-Ding", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian-Yong", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminoisobutyric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03UUH3J385", "NameOfSubstance": "tanshinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1E7ZW41IQU", "NameOfSubstance": "2-aminoisobutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G0H8C9362", "NameOfSubstance": "Cobalt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EVS87XF13W", "NameOfSubstance": "cobaltous chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aminoisobutyric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cobalt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16572993"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
