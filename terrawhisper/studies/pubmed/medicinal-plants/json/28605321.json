Antioxidant activities were investigated using different assays, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power, cupric ion-reducing antioxidant capacity, phosphomolybdenum, and metal-chelating assays. In general, the highest antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory effects were observed in methanol extracts, which had the highest concentrations of phenolics. (+)-Catechin, benzoic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were determined to be the main phenolics in H. aromaticus components both in methanol and in aqueous extracts, whereas the other 2 species present very different phenolic fingerprints, also at smaller quantities. These results suggest that these mushroom species may be considered sources of natural agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Atabey Vocational School, S\u00fcleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uren", "ForeName": "Mehmet Cemil", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Atabey Vocational School, S\u00fcleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kocak", "ForeName": "Mehmet Sefa", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Mugla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gungor", "ForeName": "Halil", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University \"G. d'Annunzio\" of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy; Interuniversity Consortium of Structural and Systems Biology, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Locatelli", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aktumsek", "ForeName": "Abdurrahman", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sarikurkcu", "ForeName": "Cengiz", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28605321", "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.v19.i4.30", "7e712f4f2518a7dc,71d6d36338fac8a0"]}}]}
