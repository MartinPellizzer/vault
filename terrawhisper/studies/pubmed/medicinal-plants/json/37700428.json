The plant-derived Ag NPs biosynthesis comprises the interaction between silver nitrate (precursor) and bioactive components of plant extract (reducing agents). In this work, Ag NPs were biosynthesized using Osbeckia stellata leaves aqueous extract. Characterization of Ag NPs was done by using ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Further, antioxidant, antidiabetic, cytotoxicity, and antimicrobial activities were evaluated to establish the pharmacological properties of Ag NPs. UV-Vis spectroscopy and FTIR showed an absorption peak of Ag NPs due to the surface plasmonic resonance. In contrast, the particle size in the nanometer range was analyzed by XRD and DLS. The size of the particle was confirmed by the SEM, TEM, and EDX in the nanometer range. This study showed the spherical shape and crystalline nature of NPs. Zeta potential was used to determine the stability of Ag NPs. Biosynthesized Ag NPs showed significantly potent antioxidant, antidiabetic, and cytotoxicity activity. Ag NPs also showed effectiveness against gram-positive (Escherichia coli) and gram-negative (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria in the antimicrobial activity study. The result concluded that these Ag NPs might be used in biomedical and pharmacological fields."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Tea Science, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Baishya", "ForeName": "Tania", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "Gouhar Jahan", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Dua", "ForeName": "Tarun Kumar", "Initials": "TK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Paramita", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Nandi", "ForeName": "Gouranga", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "Ankita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Limbu", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Anoop", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Adhikari", "ForeName": "Manab Deb", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Tea Science, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "Malay", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2229-1019"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Sahu", "ForeName": "Ranabir", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Science and Engineering Research Board", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "University Grants Commission", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "University of North Bengal", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Appl Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8609465", "ISSNLinking": "0885-4513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bayda S, Adeel M, Tuccinardi T, Cordani M, Rizzolio F.
