This information will help to provide a foundation for plant-based drug discovery in the near future.", "The online databases such as Scifinder, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar were used to collect electronically available literature data on C.\u00a0pareira. Ayurveda text is searched for the traditional uses of this plant in India. The published books are also searched for the information on this plant. Our search was based on traditional uses, botany, phytochemistry, and pharmacological potential by using \"Cissampelos pareira\" as the keyword.", "To date, approximately 54 phytomolecules have been isolated and characterized from C.\u00a0pareira including mainly isoquinoline alkaloids along with few flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, and fatty acids. The crude extracts of C.\u00a0pareira have shown various pharmacological activities such as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic, antiulcer, antidiabetic, anticancer, antifertility, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antivenom, antimalarial, and immunomodulatory, etc. The chemical fingerprinting of C.\u00a0pareira carried out using HPTLC, HPLC, UPLC, LC-MS, and GC-MS, revealed the presence of alkaloids (isoquinoline alkaloids), fatty acids, and flavonoid glycosides. Moreover, the toxicological assessment of C.\u00a0pareira has been moderately investigated, which requires further comprehensive studies.", "Comprehensive literature survey reveals that till date, remarkable growth has been made on phytochemistry and pharmacology of C.\u00a0pareira reflecting the great medicinal potential of this plant. Although some of the traditional uses have been well clarified and documented by modern pharmacological analysis, the correlation between its pharmacological activities and particular phytoconstituents still needs to be validated. Furthermore, there is partial data available on most of the pharmacological studies, along with incomplete toxicological screening. Future research needs to pay more attention to pharmacological studies of C.\u00a0pareira via pre-clinical and clinical trials. Additionally, scientific validation of traditional knowledge of C.\u00a0pareira is vital for ensuring safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action before clinical uses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
