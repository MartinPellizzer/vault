In the present study, the anti-atherosclerosis effects of EG and the underlying mechanisms were explored using macrophage cultures, zebrafish and apolipoprotein (apo) E deficient mice. Treatment of macrophages with EG (20\u00a0\u03bcM) enhanced cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL, and reduced net lipid accumulation in response to oxidized LDL. Secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from activated macrophages was also blunted by EG. Fluorescence imaging techniques revealed EG feeding of zebrafish reduced vascular lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in\u00a0vivo. Similar results were obtained in apoE<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> mice 6.5 months of age, where plaque lesions and monocyte infiltration into the artery wall were reduced by 70% and 42%, respectively, after just 6 weeks of injections with EG (20\u00a0mg/kg). HDL-cholesterol increased 2-fold, serum cholesterol efflux capacity increased by \u223c30%, and the levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 were reduced with EG treatment of mice. These results suggest EG impedes early atherosclerosis development by reducing the lipid and macrophage-content of plaque. Underlying mechanisms appeared to involve HDL cholesterol efflux mechanisms and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
