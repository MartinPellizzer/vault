Next,download the medicinal plants' DNA fragments from the NCBI database, including ITS, matK, rbcL, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA, then design probe by using Array Designer 4. 2. Finally, analyze each probe's versatility in the same kind of original plant and conservatism in different kinds of original plants by using Matlab, then determine the specificity of the probe.", "Regarding the Latin name of 586 original plants in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010 edition) and the above five gene fragments as retrieval condition, 7 613 sequences were downloaded from NCBI, then 315 436 probes were got in total by analyzing. What's more, after analyzing versatility and conservatism of the probes,13 814 specific probes were got. Furthermore,in theory, 376 kinds of original plants could be detected. Because there existed the lack of related gene fragments in the NCBI database,or the sequences were short of specificity,210 species of original plants which were involved in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia didn't receive the corresponding probe.", "The results of the study can provide the further development of medicinal plants' identification chip with vital information support,and the excavation methods of probe can be widely used. Furthermore,the results of the study indicate the original plants which need sequencing importantly in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-yong", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Xu-qiang", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Xiao-dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Ju-xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian-wen", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26027118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
