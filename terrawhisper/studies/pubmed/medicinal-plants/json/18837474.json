The process was performed using a preparative SFE system under 35 MPa of pressure, 65 degrees C of temperature, and modified CO(2) with 95% ethanol for 180 min dynamic extraction. Then, the crude extract was successfully isolated and separated by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD). A two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water was used for HSCCC separation in a stepwise elution mode. The upper phase of the solvent system at the volume ratio of 1:1:1.4:0.6 by volume was used as the stationary phase, and the mobile phase after 200 min was changed into the lower phase of the solvent system at the volume ratio of 1:1.2:1.4:0.6 by volume. The separation produced a total of 20.8 mg diosgenin, 12.1 mg linoleic acid, and 18.4 mg linolenic acid from 300 mg crude extract in one-step purification. The purities of the products were 98.9, 99.0, and 99.4%, respectively, as determined by HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified by MS, UV, and the standards."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Youwei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Deshi", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jinyong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Libin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K49P2K8WLX", "NameOfSubstance": "Diosgenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Diosgenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18837474", "10.1002/jssc.200800295"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
