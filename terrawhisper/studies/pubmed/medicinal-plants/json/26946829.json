Beginning in late July, the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake of stems and leaves sped up. Starting from the occurrence peak in August, the roots of nutrient uptake sped up. In late September, the dry matter accumulation of root reached a peak. In early October, the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake slowed down significantly.
