Geo-herbals have a high reputation, compared with other regions produced by the same kind of herbs with good quality, efficacy and stable quality characteristics. Geo-herbal is a unique concept that has been formed by the history of Chinese civilization for thousands of years and the history of Chinese medicine. According to the definition of geo-herbal, it can be seen that there are some differences in the quality and efficacy of the same kind of medicinal herbs in different regions, and there is some similarity in the specific area. In this study, the spatial distribution characteristics of artemisinin in Artemisia annua were analyzed by spatial statistical analysis. \u2460The spatial autocorrelation of artemisinin content was analyzed by \"I coefficient\". The results showed that the content of artemisinin in each province was significant and positive spatial autocorrelation. The content of artemisinin in each province was not randomly distributed, but with a clear spatial aggregation characteristics. \u2461The spatial variability of artemisinin content was analyzed by \"G statistic\". The results showed that the area with high content of artemisinin was distributed in the southwest region, and the content of artemisinin was concentrated in the space, which tends to accumulate at high value. The content of artemisinin in Tianjin and Liaoning province is low, and it tends to accumulate at low value, while the content of artemisinin in other provinces is the transition zone of high and low value. \u2462Based on the index of artemisinin in each province, the spatial correlation of artemisinin content in each region was analyzed by \"moran scatter plot\". The results showed that the content of artemisinin in nine provinces such as Guangxi and Chongqing belonged to high value gathering area. \u2463Based on the artemisinin content and ecological environment factor of sampling point, the \"geophysical detector\" was used to analyze the continuous quantitative data and discontinuous qualitative data. The results showed that the sunshine, temperature and precipitation were the main factors affecting the content of artemisinin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Dong", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xian", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Analysis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318819", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0168"]}}]}
