Data were collected by direct interviews and group meetings from 81 inhabitants including 32 local healers having information regarding the use of indigenous medicinal plants over a period of one year. Different statistical tools were applied to analyze the data including Frequency citation (FC), Relative frequency citation (RFC), Use Value, Factor of informants consensus and fidelity level. This study reported 73 plant species belonging to 37 plant families and 46 genera. The majority of plant species belong to compositae family. The most commonly used medicinal plants were P. hysterophorus L., P. dactylifera L., S. indicum L, P. harmala L., P. emblica L., and A. indica A.Juss. The greatest number of species was used to cure gastrointestinal disorders. The highest fidelity level (68.18%) was of E. helioscopia to cure gastrointestinal disorders. Maximum fresh uses (17) were reported by C. dactylon (L.) Pars. While the highest number of species reporting fresh uses in similar number was 13. In this study, five novel plants are being reported for the first time in Pakistan for their ethnomedicinal worth. Our data reflect unique usage of the medicinal plants in the study area. The statistical tools used in the study proved useful in pointing the most important and disease category specific plants. High use value plant and the new reported medicinal plants might prove an important source of the isolation of pharmacologically active compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1220-6570"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quaid-i-Azam University, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sharif", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1025-4082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "COMSATS University, Department of Biosciences, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5113-8400"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of AWAKUM, Department of Botany, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rauf", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9649-388X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Education, Division of Science and Technology, Department of Botany, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hadayat", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5493-5130"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hazara University, Department of Botany, Manshera, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Gul", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3093-3042"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kohat University of Science and Technology, Department of Botany, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nawaz", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4584-6718"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Swat, Centre of Plant Biodiversity, Swat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sakhi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Okara, Department of Botany, Okara, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7707-5751"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quaid-i-Azam University, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9323-9181"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jazan University, Medical Research Centre, Jazan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Peshawar, Centre of Plant Biodiversity, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Azam", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bacha Khan University, Department of Agriculture, Charsdda, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iftikhar", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5719-3139"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National University of Medical Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Rawalpindi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5496-7861"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan University, College of Forestry, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Bahadur", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Islamia college Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6944-664X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University, School of Ecology and Environmental Science, Kunming, Yunnan, PR.
