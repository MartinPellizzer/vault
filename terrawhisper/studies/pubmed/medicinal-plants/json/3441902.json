Experiments were performed using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and suspensions of gel-filtered platelets (GFP). Platelets were deposited on C III mainly as surface-bound aggregates. In contrast they were deposited on C IV mainly as spread forms of individual cells. Formation of aggregates on C III was more extensive for PRP than for GFP; in contrast platelet spreading on C IV was more extensive for GFP than for PRP. The effects of an extract of the plant feverfew on platelet-collagen interactions were determined. Feverfew extract inhibited the deposition of 51-Cr-labeled platelets on both C III and C IV in a dose-dependent way. Similar concentrations of extract were needed to inhibit the formation of surface-bound aggregates and to inhibit platelet spreading in both PRP and GFP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pathological Biochemistry, Medical Academy of Erfurt, GDR."}], "LastName": "L\u00f6sche", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mazurov", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heptinstall", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Groenewegen", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Repin", "ForeName": "V S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Till", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Thromb Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0326377", "ISSNLinking": "0049-3848"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromium Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3441902", "10.1016/0049-3848(87)90383-5", "0049-3848(87)90383-5"]}}]}
