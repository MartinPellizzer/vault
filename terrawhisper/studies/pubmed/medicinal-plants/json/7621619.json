The results showed that in nondiabetic rat C speciosus and N tuberosa had no significant effect in the fasting or postprandial state when freeze-dried juices were fed simultaneously with glucose. However, when fed 30 min before the glucose load both C speciosus (p < 0.05) and N tuberosa (p < 0.003) showed hypoglycemic effect. To the contrary, S hernandifolia increased the serum glucose levels of nondiabetic rats in all the series of experiments (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In NIDDM model rats N tuberosa opposed the rise in serum glucose level when it was fed 30 min before the glucose load (p < 0.02), whereas S hernandifolia had a tendency to raise the serum glucose level. In IDDM model rats, none of these three freeze-dried juice showed any effect in the fasting state. However, C speciosus showed significant hypoglycemic effect (p < 0.002) when the juice was fed with simultaneous glucose load. In marked contrast to the findings with nondiabetic and NIDDM model rats S hernandifolia showed significant hypoglycemic effect (p < 0.05-0.006) in both the stages (fed simultaneously with, and 30 min before the glucose load) of prandial states of the IDDM model rats. The results indicated that these three plants have interesting possibilities as a source of oral hypoglycemic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Mosihuzzaman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nahar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rokeya", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nur-E-Alam", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nandi", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Diabetes Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8502339", "ISSNLinking": "0265-5985"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7621619"]}}]}
