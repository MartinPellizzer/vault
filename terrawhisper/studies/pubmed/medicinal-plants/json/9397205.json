The structures of the new products were established from spectral and chemical evidence as 2-methoxyanofinic acid and macrophyllosides A-D. The six known secoiridoids were gentiopicroside, sweroside, 6'-O-beta-D-glucosylgentiopicroside, 6'-O-beta-D-glucosylsweroside, trifloroside and rindoside. The new acid (2-methoxyanofinic acid), its methyl ester, kurarinone and kushenol I were shown to be active against the plant pathogenic fungus Cladosporium cucumerinum. The methyl ester and kurarinone inhibited also the growth of the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Structure-activity relationships were studied. Thus, addition of a methoxyl group to the benzene nucleus of anofinic acid (2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid) increased the antifungal activity remarkably whereas glycosylation at the carboxylic moiety was found to remove the activity. Esterification of the new acid induced its activity against C. albicans, but decreased its growth inhibition properties against C. cucumerinum. Hydroxylation of kurarinone at the 3 beta-position removed its activity against C. albicans and decreased the inhibition of C. cucumerinum. In addition, the chemotaxonomic significance of the identified constituents is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Pharmacognosie et Phytochimie, Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "R X", "Initials": "RX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wolfender", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "L X", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fuzzati", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marston", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hostettmann", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9397205", "10.1016/0031-9422(96)00149-5", "0031-9422(96)00149-5"]}}]}
