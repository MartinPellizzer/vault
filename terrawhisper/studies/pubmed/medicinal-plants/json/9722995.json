A concentration-dependent response was observed. Quillaja saponaria saponins from Sigma increased growth up to 0.1% (w/v) level, whereas Nor-feed and Roth saponins produced maximum growth at a much higher level (0.5 and 0.75%, w/v, respectively). These results suggest that quillaja saponins from various sources differ in their biological activity, although all three saponins had the same content of vanillin-sulphuric acid reactive moieties. The lyophilized water extract from the DK Sarsaponin powder showed maximum growth at 0.1% (w/v) level. The levels at which maximum growth was observed did not change on subjecting the quillaja or yucca saponins to heat treatment in an autoclave (121 degrees C for 30 min). All the saponins and the plant extract increased growth of Escherichia coli up to a certain concentration and thereafter decreased growth. In spite of the decreased growth at higher levels of saponins, it was higher compared to the control (without saponin) up to levels of 1% (w/v) for all saponins except Quillaja saponins from Sigma, for which the growth was lower at levels of 0.25% (w/v) and higher. Saponins have the potential to modulate microbial growth in natural and artificial fermenters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Animal Production in the Tropics and Subtropics, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Makkar", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muetzel", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spirostans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CFS802C28F", "NameOfSubstance": "sarsasapogenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Spirostans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9722995", "10.1046/j.1472-765x.1998.00379.x"]}}]}
