Piper betel inflorescence, which contains 15 mg/g safrole, is a unique ingredient of BQ in Taiwan. Chewing such prepared BQ may contribute to safrole exposure in human beings (420 microM safrole in saliva). Safrole is a known rodent hepatocarcinogen, yet its carcinogenicity in human beings is largely undetermined. In this study, using a (32)P-post-labeling method, we have found a high frequency of safrole-like DNA adducts in BQ-associated OSCC (77%, 23/30) and non-cancerous matched tissue (NCMT) (97%, 29/30). This was in contrast to the absence (< 1/10(9) nucleotides) of such adducts in all of non-BQ-associated OSCC and their paired NCMT (P < 0.001). Six of seven OSF also exhibited the same safrole-like DNA adduct. The DNA adduct levels in OSF and NCMT were significantly higher than in OSCC (P < 0.05). Using co-chromatography and rechromatography techniques, we further demonstrated that these adducts were identical to synthetic safrole-dGMP adducts as well as DNA adducts from 1'-hydroxysafrole-treated HepG2 cells. These results suggest that safrole forms stable safrole-DNA adducts in human oral tissue following BQ chewing, which may contribute to oral carcinogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RSB34337V9", "NameOfSubstance": "Safrole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Safrole"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10590228", "10.1093/carcin/20.12.2331"]}}]}
