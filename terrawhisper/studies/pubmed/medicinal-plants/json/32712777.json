Nanoemulsions can enhance solubilization property of poorly water-soluble drugs and increase the drug loading. In this study, we used a nanoemulsion composed of benzalkonium chloride as surfactant, cyclohexane as oil phase, and ethanol as co-surfactant in water, to load small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule. The system was investigated by three coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that siRNA attached to benzalkonium chloride on the surface of the nanoemulsion and the oil beads were located in the hydrophobic core of the nanoemulsion, which made its size larger. The ethanol beads distributed throughout the system and did not enter to the hydrophilic shell of the nanoemulsion. The nanoemulsion structure was a compact prolate ellipsoid shape, before and after carrying the siRNA. The average value of radius of gyration of the nanoemulsion was 1.68\u00a0nm before and after joining siRNA and the average value of physical radius was 2.17\u00a0nm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pirhadi", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran. aamani@sina.tums.ac.ir."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. aamani@sina.tums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Amani", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "95-02-181-32474", "Agency": "Tehran University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Model", "NlmUniqueID": "9806569", "ISSNLinking": "0948-5023"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Interfering"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Aquifex aeolicus"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aquifex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Transfer Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Interfering"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32712777", "10.1007/s00894-020-04471-9", "10.1007/s00894-020-04471-9"]}}]}
