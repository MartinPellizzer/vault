Under circumstances of guaranteeing the quality and yield of medicinal materials. the yield of medicinal materials. and stems and leaves reached 193.60,63.21 kg/mu after twice cutting seedling. Not only yield but also active ingredient contents have been improved to some extent. the contents of flavonoids. baicalin. wogonoside. baicalein. wogonin. oroxylin A reached 18.52%. 15.13%. 4.03%. 1.04%. 1.04%. 0.12%. respectively in roots. Luteolin was not detected in young stems and leaves of S. baicalensis,the contents of other active ingredients such as scutellarin. luteolin and apigenin reached 7.00%. 0.96%. 0.04% respectively under twice cutting seedling. Therefore. regular cutting seedling could be regard as a new cultivation technique for wider range of promotion.
