Beef loaf (15 kg), potatoes (6 kg), and green beans (5 kg) were prepared in a laboratory. After initial cooking to 60 degrees C, and storage (7 degrees C for 24 h), beef loaf (100 g) was microwave heated: 20, 50, 80 or 110 s. Potatoes were reconstituted, stored (7 degrees C for 24 h), portioned (100 g/portion), and microwave-heated: 25, 45, 65 or 84 s. Beans were thawed (7 degrees C for 24 h), portioned (100 g/portion), and microwave-heated: 20, 50, 80 or 110 s. Aerobic plate counts (APC) for foods were obtained throughout product flow. Wide ranges of Et and of APC in foods indicates that research is needed, for greater control of microwave-heating through advanced microwave engineering and food technology, to produce food with constant microbiological quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dahl", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matthews", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marth", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "J Microw Power", "NlmUniqueID": "0332155", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2739"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiological Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7003155", "10.1080/16070658.1980.11689192"]}}]}
