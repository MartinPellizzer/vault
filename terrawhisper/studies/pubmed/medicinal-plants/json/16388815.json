The parameters that may affect the extraction efficiencies in PHWE include temperature, extraction time and addition of small percentage of organic solvent or surfactants. Currently, applications of PHWE for the extraction of thermally labile compounds in botanicals are still rather limited. PHWE with and without the additional of a small percentage of organic solvent such as ethanol is highly suited for the chemical standardization and quality control of medicinal plants. At the same time, it can be applied at the pilot scale as a manufacturing process for medicinal plants. Surfactant assisted PHWE was found to enhance the extraction of thermally labile and more hydrophobic species in medicinal plants at a lower temperature. The addition of small amount of surfactants in PHWE is highly suited for the determination of bioactive or marker compounds in medicinal plants. With proper optimization, PHWE was observed to have good extraction efficiency and precision when compared to other reference methods of extraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Science School, Temasek Polytechnic, 21 Tampines Avenue 1, Singapore 59757, Singapore. esong@tp.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheong", "ForeName": "Jane Si Han", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goh", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}], "NumberOfReferences": "82"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388815", "10.1016/j.chroma.2005.12.052", "S0021-9673(05)02436-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
