When compared with potassium iodate (PI), iodine-rich herbs had a positive effect on the recovery of goiter resulting from iodine deficiency without any obvious harmful effects. In NOD.H-2<sup>h4</sup> mice, an autoimmune thyroiditis-prone model, iodine excess can increase infiltration of lymphocytes and structural damage of the thyroid follicles, hence resulting in thyroiditis. Until now, there has been little research on the comparative effects of PI and iodine-rich herbs on thyroid in an autoimmune thyroiditis-prone model. This study was designed to compare the different effects of iodine-rich herbs and PI on the thyroid gland in iodine-deficient NOD.H-2<sup>h4</sup> mice. Excessive intake of PI cause oxidative injury in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of autoimmune thyroiditis, while iodine-rich herbs cause less oxidative injury, significantly enhancing antioxidant capacity, and inhibit the high differentiation of Th17 cells in the thyroid glands of NOD.H-2<sup>h4</sup> mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5948-7480"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Clinical College, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Chongshan East Road No.72, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110032, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Han", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Clinical College, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Chongshan East Road No.72, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110032, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jin-Qiao", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Clinical College, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Chongshan East Road No.72, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110032, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xi-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Clinical College, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Chongshan East Road No.72, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110032, China. gaotianshu67@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine, Affiliated Hospital, Liaoning University of TCM, Beiling Street No.33, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110032, China. gaotianshu67@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Tian-Shu", "Initials": "TS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "F10-205-1-31", "Agency": "Science and Technology Bureau,Shenyang Municipal Government", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I139E44NHL", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium iodate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iodates"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred NOD"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Th17 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Gland"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroiditis, Autoimmune"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28803408", "10.1007/s12011-017-1115-y", "10.1007/s12011-017-1115-y"]}}]}
