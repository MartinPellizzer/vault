Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids own an antitumor property and have developed as candidates for anticancer drugs. This paper aimed to study the antitumor effect of fangchinoline derivative HY-2 by targeting BLM<sup>642-1290</sup> DNA helicase, and then explore its inhibitory mechanism on proliferation of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. We confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of BLM DNA helicase in breast cancer were higher than those in normal tissues. HY-2 could inhibit the DNA binding, ATPase and DNA unwinding of BLM<sup>642-1290</sup> DNA helicase with enzymatic assay. HY-2 could also inhibit the DNA unwinding of DNA helicase in cells. In addition, HY-2 showed an inhibiting the MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells expansion. The mRNA and protein levels of BLM DNA helicase in MDA-MB-435 cells increased after HY-2 treatment, which might contribute to HY-2 inhibiting the DNA binding, ATPase and DNA unwinding of BLM DNA helicase. The mechanism of HY-2 inhibition on BLM DNA helicase was further confirmed with the effect of HY-2 on the ultraviolet spectrogram of BLM<sup>642-1290</sup> DNA helicase and Molecular dynamics simulation of the interacting between HY-2 and BLM<sup>640-1291</sup> DNA helicase. Our study provided some valuable clues for the exploration of HY-2 in the living body and developing it as an anticancer drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
