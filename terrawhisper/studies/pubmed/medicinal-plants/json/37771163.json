Saraswatharishta (SWRT), an ayurvedic formulation utilized in traditional Indian medicine, has demonstrated effectiveness in addressing neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we aim to delve into the atomistic details of the mode of action of phytochemicals present in SWRT against DLK. Our screening process encompassed over 500 distinct phytochemicals derived from the main ingredients of the SWRT formulation. Through a comparative analysis of docking scores and relative poses, we successfully identified four novel compounds, which underwent further investigation <i>via</i> 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Among the top four compounds, CID16066851 sourced from the Acorus calamus displayed the most stable complex with DLK. The molecular mechanics Poisson\u2009-\u2009Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations highlighted the significance of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in the binding recognition process. Additionally, we identified key residues, namely Phe192, Leu243, Val139, and Leu141, as hotspots that predominantly govern the DLK-inhibitor interaction. Notably, the leading compounds are sourced from the Acorus calamus, Syzygium aromaticum, Zingiber officinale, and Anethum sowa plants present in the SWRT formulation. Overall, the findings of our study hold promise for future drug development endeavors combating neurodegenerative conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
