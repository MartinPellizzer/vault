Chemotherapy is an essential means in cancer therapy, however, plant drugs having pharmacological safety, can be used alone or as additions to current chemotherapeutic agents to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize chemotherapyinduced adverse effects.", "A combination therapy where the synergistic effect on multiple targets is possible has gained significance because a one-drug one-target approach fails to yield the desired therapeutic effect. Therefore, a detailed description of important plant polyphenolic compounds with anticancer activity and their role in potentiating chemotherapeutic efficiency of existing anticancer drugs is provided in this review. Systematically screening combinations of active pharmaceutical ingredients for potential synergy with plant compounds may be especially valuable in cancer therapy.", "We extensively have gone through reviews and research articles available in the literature.
