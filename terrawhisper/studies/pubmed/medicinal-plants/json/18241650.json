Then three different doses of N3 were administered continuously to the rats for 35 days. The effects of N3 on lipid metabolism were observed by determining the levels of serum triglyceride (TG), uric acid (UA), glucose (GLU) and free fatty acids (FFA) and the activities of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and hepatic lipase (HL) from the liver and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the heart.", "Twenty-one days after feeding a high-fructose diet, the levels of serum UA, TG and GLU in the untreated group were significantly higher than those of the normal control group. Thirty-five days after administering N3, there was no statistical difference in serum TG and heart LPL activity between the untreated group and the normal control group, while liver FAS activity, serum FFA level and liver HL activity in the untreated group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group. Different doses of N3 treated rats all showed a decrease of TG, UA and GLU levels. N3 could decrease FAS activity and FFA level, and increase LPL and HL activities significantly.", "N3 in Cichorii may regulate the lipid metabolism of the rats with hypertriglyceridemia complicated by hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia by decreasing FAS activity and FFA level, and increasing LPL and HL activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qing", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "101199657", "ISSNLinking": "1672-1977"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertriglyceridemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperuricemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18241650", "10.3736/jcim20080210", "167219772008020157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
