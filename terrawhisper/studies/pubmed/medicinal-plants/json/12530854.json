A similar reaction of the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl congener 8 also gave tetrahydroindol-2-one 9, which, however, gave only a trace amount of the Mn(OAc)3-mediated cyclization product 11 and afforded the oxidation product 10. On the basis of these results, formation of 5 from 4 was thought to proceed via nucleophilic attack of the pyrrole ring on the cation-radical lX, generated by a single electron-transfer reaction of the acetoxy-substituted intermediate V. Treatment of compound 16 with Mn(OAc)3/Cu(OAc)2 gave no erythrinane derivative with recovery of the starting material, indicating that the presence of a methylthio group of 4 is essential for effecting the formation of erythrinane 5. On the other hand, treatment of 3 with Mn(OAc)3 using Cu(OTf)2 as an additive in place of Cu(OAc)2 gave another erythrinane 17. This method was applied to a formal synthesis of 3-demethoxyerythratidinone (20), a naturally occurring Erythrina alkaloid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Takara-machi, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chikaoka", "ForeName": "Shiho", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toyao", "ForeName": "Atsushi", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogasawara", "ForeName": "Mizuho", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamura", "ForeName": "Osamu", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishibashi", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetamides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12530854", "10.1021/jo020573p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
