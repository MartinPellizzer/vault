The analysis was performed using an Acquity C18 column and gradient elution of 0.05% formic acid in water and acetonitrile at a detection wavelength of 267 nm in 5 min. A high correlation coefficient (r2 > 0.998) indicated good correlation between investigated compounds concentration and their peak area within the test ranges. The LODs for compounds 3, 4, 6 and 10 were 1.95, 0.97, 3.90 and 0.97 ng/mL, respectively, and LOQs were 6.64, 3.20, 12.87 and 3.20 ng/mL, respectively. The overall intra- and inter-day variations of the four compounds were less than 1%. The variation of these four bioactive compounds in T. cordifolia hosted on fifteen different trees was also determined. The compounds (3, 4, 6 and 10) were found in high amount in the T. cordifolia hosted on Azadirachta indica and Mangifera indica as compared with other plants. Twelve compounds were identified on the basis of their mass and UV-vis spectra. The NMR fingerprinting of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, fatty acid methyl esters, polysaccharides and marker components of T. cordifolia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bala", "ForeName": "Manju", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Praveen Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Awasthi", "ForeName": "Shiv", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Neeraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "Brij", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bikram", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylpropionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cordifolioside A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tinocordiside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6F5B11C96", "NameOfSubstance": "syringin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI8K6962K4", "NameOfSubstance": "magnoflorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylpropionates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tinospora"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25920217"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
