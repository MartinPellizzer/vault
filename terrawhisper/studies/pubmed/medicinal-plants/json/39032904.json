Ginseng, red ginseng, American ginseng, and Panax notoginseng are all members of the Araliaceae family. They are known to contain a variety of medicinal properties and are typically rich in a wide range of medicinal values. Polysaccharides represent is one of the principal active ingredients in the aforementioned plants. However, there is a paucity of detailed reports on the separation methods, structural characteristics and comparison of various pharmacological effects of these polysaccharides. This paper presents a review of the latest research reports on ginseng, red ginseng, American ginseng and ginseng polysaccharides. The differences in extraction, separation, purification, structural characterization, and pharmacological activities of the four polysaccharides are compared and clarified. Upon examination of the current research literature, it becomes evident that the extraction and separation processes of the four polysaccharides are highly similar. Modern pharmacological studies have corroborated the multiple biological activities of these polysaccharides. These activities encompass a range of beneficial effects, including antioxidant stress injury, fatigue reduction, tumor inhibition, depression alleviation, regulation of intestinal flora, immunomodulation, diabetes management, central nervous system protection, anti-aging, and improvement of skin health. This paper presents a review of studies on the extraction, purification, characterization, and bioactivities of four natural plant ginseng polysaccharides. Furthermore, the review presents the most recent research findings on their pharmacological activities. The information provides a theoretical basis for the future application of natural plant polysaccharides and offers a new perspective for the in-depth development of the medicinal value of ginseng in the clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
