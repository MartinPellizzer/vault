The immunotoxin was somewhat more slowly endocytosed than the native toxin, but in both cases the endocytic uptake continued under conditions in which uptake from clathrin-coated pits was inhibited by mild acidification of the cytosol. This indicates that the toxin and the immunotoxin were at least partially internalized by a non-clathrin-dependent uptake mechanism and that uptake by this pathway is responsible for most of the toxic effect on the cells. The results indicate that efficient immunotoxins can be made with antibodies against cell surface epitopes that are endocytosed by a mechanism not involving clathrin-coated pits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Wied\u0142ocha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sandvig", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walzel", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Radzikowsky", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Olsnes", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia L1210"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1988131"]}}]}
