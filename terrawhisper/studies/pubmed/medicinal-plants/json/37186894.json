In the adult heart, the cardiac mitochondria have a unique spatial arrangement and occupy nearly one-third the volume of a cardiomyocyte, being highly efficient for converting the products of glucose or fatty acid metabolism into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In cardiomyocytes, the decline of mitochondrial function reduces ATP generation and increases the production of reactive oxygen species, which generates impaired heart function. This is because mitochondria play a key role in maintaining cytosolic calcium concentration and modulation of muscle contraction, as ATP is required to dissociate actin from myosin. Beyond that, mitochondria have a significant role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis because it is evident that patients who have cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have increased mitochondrial DNA damage to the heart and aorta. Many studies have shown that natural products have mitochondria-modulating effects in cardiac diseases, determining them as potential candidates for new medicines. This review outlines the leading plant secondary metabolites and natural compounds derived from microorganisms as modulators of mitochondrial dysfunctions associated with CVDs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chemical-Pharmaceutical Research Nucleus, University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed, Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Boeing", "ForeName": "Thaise", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pre-Clinical Research of Natural Products, Postgraduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Reis L\u00edvero", "ForeName": "Francislaine Aparecida Dos", "Initials": "FAD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chemical-Pharmaceutical Research Nucleus, University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed, Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Souza", "ForeName": "Priscila", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (LaFaC), Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Almeida", "ForeName": "Danielle Ayr Tavares", "Initials": "DAT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pre-Clinical Research of Natural Products, Postgraduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Donadel", "ForeName": "Guilherme", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pre-Clinical Research of Natural Products, Postgraduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Louren\u00e7o", "ForeName": "Emerson Luiz Botelho", "Initials": "ELB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3433-5098"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (LaFaC), Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gasparotto Junior", "ForeName": "Arquimedes", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37186894", "10.1089/jmf.2022.0022"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
