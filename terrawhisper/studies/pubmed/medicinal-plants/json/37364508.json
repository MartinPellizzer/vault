Oken is an ornamental and ethno-medicine plant, which can grow a circle of adventitious bud around the leaf margin. The dynamic change of metabolites during the development of B. pinnatum remains poorly understood. Here, leaves from B. pinnatum at four developmental stages were sampled based on morphological characteristics. A non-targeted metabolomics approach was used to evaluate the changes of endogenous metabolites during adventitious bud formation in B. pinnatum. The results showed that differential metabolites were mainly enriched in sphingolipid metabolism, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway. The metabolites assigned to amino acids, flavonoids, sphingolipids, and the plant hormone jasmonic acid decreased from period \u2160 to \u2161, and then increased from period \u2162 to \u2163 with the emergence of adventitious bud (period \u2162). While the metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the four observation periods. Depending on the metabolite changes, leaves may provide conditions similar to in vitro culture for adventitious bud to occur, thus enabling adventitious bud to grow at the leaf edge. Our results provide a basis for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of adventitious bud in B. pinnatum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
