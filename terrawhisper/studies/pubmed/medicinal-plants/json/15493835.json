By clonogenic assay, the IC50 of SAA for KB cells was 44.7 micromol x L(-1). SAA markedly potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU and mitomycin C in KB cells as well as the cytotoxicity of MTX in human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells. For in vivo experiment, sarcoma 180 cells were transplanted sc in mice and tested drugs were administered ip. When administered separately, SAA at 200 mg x kg(-1) and 5-FU at 10 mg x kg(-1) inhibited tumor growth by 41% and 27%, respectively. Combination of the two drugs inhibited tumor growth by 63% (CDI = 0.86).", "SAA is active in blocking nucleoside transport in cancer cells and potentiates the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs.
