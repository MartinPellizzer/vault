The background electrolyte (BGE) used in the CZE step was different from the leading and terminating ITP electrolytes but all the electrolytes contained 20% (v/v) of methanol. The optimal leading electrolyte was 10 mM HCl of pH* approximately 7.2 (adjusted with Tris) and the terminating electrolyte was 50 mM H3BO3 of pH* approximately 8.2 (adjusted with barium hydroxide). This operational system allowed to concentrate and pre-separate selectively the flavonoid fraction from other plant constituents before the introduction of the flavonoids into the CZE capillary. The BGE for the CZE step was 50 mM Tris buffer of pH* approximately 8.75 containing 25 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid as co-ion and 55 mM H3BO3 as complex-forming agent. The ITP-CZE method with spectrophotometric detection at 254 nm was suitable for the quantitation of the flavonoids in real natural samples; kaempferol was used as internal standard. The limit of detection for quercetin-3-O-glycosides was 100 ng ml(-1) and calibration curves were rectilinear in the range 1-10 microg ml (-1) for most of the analytes. The RSD values ranged between 0.9 and 2.7% (n=3) when determining approximately 0.07-1.2% of the individual flavonoids in dried medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urb\u00e1nek", "ForeName": "Marek", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blechtov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Lucie", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Posp\u00edsilov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Marie", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pol\u00e1sek", "ForeName": "Miroslav", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclodextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R57ZHV85D4", "NameOfSubstance": "boric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclodextrins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12134824", "10.1016/s0021-9673(02)00316-3", "S0021-9673(02)00316-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
