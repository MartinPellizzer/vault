(O. corniculate) was used to treat diabetes in Chinese folk as a popular tea drink. In this work, 31 compounds from O. corniculate were screened and identified as potential \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitors (\u03b1-GIs). Among them, 6 compounds displayed stronger inhibitory activity than acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0212.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.98\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Especially, the most effective compounds quercetin (Qu, IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a04.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and luteolin (Lu, IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a015.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.75\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) inhibited \u03b1-Glu in competitive and mixed manners, respectively. Moreover, fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism (CD), and molecular docking study revealed that they can arouse the changes in the secondary structure and hydrophobic micro-environment of the enzyme mainly through a hydrophobic binding. Furthermore, it was observed that oral administration of Qu (20\u00a0mg/kg) can significantly reduce postprandial blood glucose (PBG) levels in mice vs. the control group. To sum up, the above research confirmed that O. corniculate could prevent and treat postprandial hyperglycemia as a good tea drink, and the plant was an excellent source to obtain natural \u03b1-GIs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
