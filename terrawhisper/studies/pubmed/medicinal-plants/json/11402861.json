Sequencing of some of the fragments (c. 1.7 kb) showed that the type strain (ATTC PV-107) of Oat necrotic mottle virus is not a distinct species in the genus Rymovirus, but is synonymous with Brome streak mosaic virus (genus Tritimovirus) and that Celery mosaic virus is a distinct member of the genus Potyvirus not closely related to any other sequenced species. Potyviruses infecting crops in China were also investigated, showing that viruses on cowpea and maize in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province were respectively Bean common mosaic virus and Sugarcane mosaic virus and that one on garlic in Nanjing, Jiangsu province was Onion yellow dwarf virus. Fragments were also sequenced from Chinese isolates of Lettuce mosaic virus and Soybean mosaic virus (from Hangzhou), Turnip mosaic virus (2 different isolates from Zhejiang province) and RNA1 of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (from Rongcheng, Shandong province)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. jpchen@mail.hz.zj.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Avena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consensus Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Potyviridae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Potyvirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11402861", "10.1007/s007050170144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
