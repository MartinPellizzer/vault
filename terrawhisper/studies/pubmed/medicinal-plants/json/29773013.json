One of these is curcumin, which is an easily accessible, inexpensive, and nontoxic bioactive compound. Curcumin is a very important, naturally occurring, and highly lipophilic and phenolic substance derived from the rhizomes of plant Curcuma longa, a member of the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, which is mostly used as a curry spice, flavoring agent, insect repellent, coloring agent in food, traditional drug, and ingredient in cosmetics. Modern scientific research has demonstrated that it has wide range of pharmacological activities and medicinal properties against various types of diseases, disorders, and syndromes. Because it has been known for many years to have excellent therapeutic potential against various diseases, much research has been devoted to this natural product. This review briefly summarizes the scope, therapeutic potential and clinical applications of curcumin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan; Department of Applied Chemistry, Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akbar", "ForeName": "Muhammad Usman", "Initials": "MU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy, Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Kanwal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zia", "ForeName": "Khalid Mahmood", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Bosan Road, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qadir", "ForeName": "Muhammad Imran", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akash", "ForeName": "Muhammad Sajid Hamid", "Initials": "MSH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr", "NlmUniqueID": "9007261", "ISSNLinking": "1045-4403"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29773013", "10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2018020088", "642ad759707fc517,09638c6d10ed7391"]}}]}
