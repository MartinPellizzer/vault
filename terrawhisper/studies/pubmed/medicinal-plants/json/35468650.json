This study aimed to systematically review herbs and herb-derived compounds or herbal formulations that have been investigated for their anti-cholangiocarcinoma potential. Systematic literature searches were conducted in three electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. One hundred and twenty-three research articles fulfilled the eligibility critera and were included in the analysis (68 herbs, isolated compounds and/or synthetic analogs, 9 herbal formulations, and 119 compounds that are commonly found in several plant species). The most investigated herbs were <i>Atractylodes lancea</i> (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae) and <i>Curcuma longa</i> L. (Zingiberaceae). Only <i>A.\u00a0lancea</i> (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae) has undergone the full process of nonclinical and clinical development to deliver the final product for clinical use. The extracts of <i>A.\u00a0lancea</i> (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae), <i>Garcinia hanburyi</i> Hook.f. (Clusiaceae), and <i>Piper nigrum</i> L. (Piperaceae) exhibit antiproliferative activities against human cholangiocarcinoma cells (IC<sub>50</sub> <\u200915\u2009\u00b5g/mL). Cucurbitacin B and triptolide are herbal isolated compounds that exhibit the most promising activities (IC<sub>50</sub> <\u20091\u2009\u00b5M). A series of experimental studies (<i>in vitro, in vivo</i>, and humans) confirmed the anti-cholangiocarcinoma potential and safety profile of <i>A.\u00a0lancea</i> (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae) and its active compounds atractylodin and <i>\u03b2</i>-eudesmol, including the capsule pharmaceutical of the standardized <i>A.\u00a0lancea</i> (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae) extract. Future research should be focused on the full development of the candidate herbs to deliver products that are safe and effective for cholangiocarcinoma control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
