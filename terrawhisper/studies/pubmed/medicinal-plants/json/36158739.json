Synthetic drugs used in the treatment of liver and kidney diseases are sometimes inadequate and can lead to serious side effects. Medicinal herbs and plants were used to combat diseases for a long time and combination therapy is preferred over single plant therapy. In the current study, the <i>Asparagus racemosus, Mucuna pruriens, Anacyclus pyrethrum</i>, and <i>Tribulus terrestris</i> polyherbal preparation (PHP) was selected to evaluate its hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-nephrotoxic potential. The methanolic extract of PHP was prepared following standard protocols. Fifty-six albino rats were divided into 7 groups (n = 8). The negative control (NC) having the healthy rats and the remaining 6 groups were induced liver toxicity by intraperitoneally injecting 0.5\u00a0mL/kg of 50% CCl<sub>4</sub> in olive oil. Group 2 was positive control and group 3 and 4 received silymarin standard drug at the dose of 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight. Groups 5, 6, and 7 (PHP-1, PHP-2, PHP-3) were the liver-damaged rats receiving the PHP at a dose of 50, 100, and 150\u00a0mg/kg body weight. Blood samples were collected at 21 of the trial, to evaluate oxidative stress, hepatoprotective and anti-nephrotoxic potential. Results of liver function tests revealed significant (<i>P</i> < .05) hepatoprotective activities of PHP after intoxication with CCl<sub>4</sub> of albino rats as compared to standard groups. Moreover, results of renal functions also showed that PHP has a significant (<i>P</i> < .05) restoring the capacity of blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid in intoxicated rats as compared with the control group. The PHP also reduced the oxidative stress in the treatment groups by increasing the total antioxidant capacity and reducing the total oxidative status. It can be concluded that selected medicinal plants have a potential role in the management of liver and kidney disorders. So, by running the clinical trial on a large scale and by isolating the phytochemical constituents responsible for hepatoprotective and nephroprotective activities, locally prepared drugs could be developed to manage liver and renal disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Boota", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Muhammad Ali", "Initials": "SMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medical Science, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Abid", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7457-8572"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ayaz", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore-Pakistan, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "Imtiaz", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3649-2612"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nisar", "ForeName": "Jaweria", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["72594"], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nisar", "ForeName": "Zonaira", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dose Response", "NlmUniqueID": "101308899", "ISSNLinking": "1559-3258"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Giannini EG, Farinati F, Ciccarese F, et al..
