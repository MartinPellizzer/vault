In the present study, thirty-nine natural compounds of Ashwagandha were investigated in terms of their binding to the important drug targets to treat the COVID-19. Although the molecular docking calculations reveal the binding affinities of the compounds to Mpro, TMPRSS2, NSP15, PLpro, Spike RBD\u2009+\u2009ACE2, RdRp and NSP12 as targets in controlling the coronavirus enzymes, Withanoside II is expected to be the most effective compound due to the high affinity in binding with many of considered targets. Furthermore, the Withanoside III, IV, V, X, and XI have favorable binding affinities as ligands with respect to the MM/GBSA calculations. The molecular dynamics simulations MD explore a stable hydrogen bond network between ligands and the active sites residues. Also, the dynamic fluctuations of the binding site residues verify their tight binding to ligands. Moreover, the stability of ligand-protein complexes is approved by the RMSD ranges lower than 0.5 \u00c5 in equilibration zone for all mentioned complexes. The TMPRSS2-Withanolide Q and Mpro-Withanoside IV complexes are the most stable pairs using the MM/GBSA calculations and MD simulation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
