It was found that P. polyphylla has been used as a medicinal plant by eight ethnic minorities. A total of 62 experiential effective recipes, including 29 simple recipes and 33 compound recipes, were analyzed for their indications, traditional processing methods, medicinal compatibilities, and administration doses. The top three in the eight ethnic minorities sorted by the quantity of folk recipes were the Yi nationality(18), Naxi nationality(13) and Bai nationality(12). P. polyphylla has been widely employed for the treatment of nine categories of diseases, especially the dermatologic diseases, trauma, and toxicosis currently. The collating of material basis for its traditional functions revealed 26 active components, among which 19 were steroidal saponins capable of resisting cancer, furuncles, carbuncles, abscesses, bacteria, inflammation and stopping bleeding. This study preliminarily proved the efficacy of P. polyphylla in treating cancer and respiratory system, digestive system, and genitourinary system diseases, which has provided clues for related basic research of P. polyphylla and development of new preparations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xiu-Xiang", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences Kunming 650201, China School of Ethnic Medicine, Yunnan Minzu University Kunming 650504, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Qi-Dong", "Initials": "QD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hao-Yun", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Yunnan Minzu University Kunming 650504, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marxism, Southwest Forestry University Kunming 650224, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences Kunming 650201, China School of Ethnic Medicine, Yunnan Minzu University Kunming 650504, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Xin", "Initials": "LX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnic and Racial Minorities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34994126", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210901.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
