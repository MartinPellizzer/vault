The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that investigated UTI recurrence using THM treatment.", "The results of 22 studies showed that THM treatment led to significantly fewer UTI events in the experimental group than in the control group (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.348; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.257 to 0.473; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Seventeen studies reported UTI events during the follow-up period, and the recurrence rate was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (OR, 0.326; 95% CI, 0.245-0.434; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Subgroup analysis further showed that compared to antibiotics alone, treatment with THM plus antibiotics significantly reduced UTI events in the acute phase (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.301; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.201 to 0.431; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as well as in the follow-up period (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.347; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.241 to 0.498; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, THM treatment alone was not superior to antibiotics in the acute treatment phase (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.540; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.250 to 1.166; p\u00a0=\u00a00.117) or in the follow-up period (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.464; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.111 to 1.951; p\u00a0=\u00a00.295). Herbal ingredients for recurrent UTI events also showed benefits compared to placebo treatment in the acute phase (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.337; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.158 to 0.717; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and during follow-up (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.238; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.139 to 0.409; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).", "THM combined with antibiotics is helpful for people with acute UTIs and for reinfection prevention.
