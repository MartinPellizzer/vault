Particularly, it has attracted a great deal of attention as a promising and multitarget anticancer agent due to its potential use in chemoprevention and chemotherapy of various tumors. However, unfavorable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics profile such as poor bioavailability restricted its applications. Therefore, medicinal chemists have synthesized a lot of novel derivatives and analogues of resveratrol using different modification strategies to overcome these limitations and improve anticancer efficacy. Herein, we reviewed the design, synthesis, structure-activity relationship and mechanism of the most potent and privileged resveratrol-based compounds that showed promising anticancer activities in the last five years. We classified these compounds into the ten different categories based on their chemical structure similarities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
