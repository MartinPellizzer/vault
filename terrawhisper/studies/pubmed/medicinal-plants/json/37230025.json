They are disappearing rapidly due to anthropogenic pressure, overexploitation, unsustainable harvesting, lack of knowledge on cultivation, and the availability of quality plating materials. In this context, standardized in-vitro propagation protocol was followed to produce Valeriana jatamansi Jones, and transferred in two locations at Kosi-Katarmal (GBP) Almora (1200 masl) and Sri Narayan Ashram (SNA) Pithoragarh (Altitude 2750 masl), Uttarakhand. Over the three years of growth, plants were gathered from both locations for determining biochemical and physiological parameters, and growth performance. The plants growing at Sri Narayan Ashram (SNA) showed considerably (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher amounts of polyphenolics, antioxidant activities, and phenolic compounds. Similarly, physiological parameters (transpiration 0.004\u00a0mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; photosynthesis 8.20\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; stomatal conductance 0.24\u00a0mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), plant growth performance (leaves number 40, roots number 30, root length 14\u00a0cm) and soil attributes (total nitrogen 9.30; potassium 0.025; phosphorus 0.34\u00a0mg/g, respectively) were found best in the SNA as compared to GBP. In addition, moderate polar solvent (i.e., acetonitrile and methanol) was found suitable for extracting higher bioactive constituents from plants. The findings from this study revealed that large-scale cultivation of V. jatamansi should promote at higher elevation areas such as Sri Narayan Ashram to harness the maximum potential of the species. Such a protective approach with the right interventions will be helpful to provide livelihood security to the local populace along with quality material for commercial cultivation. This can fulfill the demand through regular supply of raw material to the industries and simultaneously promote their conservation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
