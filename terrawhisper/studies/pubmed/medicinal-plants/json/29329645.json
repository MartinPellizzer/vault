In the in vivo experiment, 1 mL of 5% sodium thioglycollate was injected into the abdomen of the mice on Day 0 and macrophages were harvested on Day 4. The macrophages were cultured in plates and treated with different concentrations of BCPs and stimulus. Effects of BCPs on macrophage functions were assessed by chemotaxis assay, phagocytosis assay and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Our results showed the enhanced chemotaxis, phagocytosis and secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines by macrophages when treated with BCPs. However, when chemotaxis and phagocytosis were up-regulated by complement components or opsonized particles, BCPs inhibited these effects. Also, the NO production induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was suppressed by BCPs mildly. Moreover, BCPs had an inhibitory effect on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation of macrophages. These results suggested that BCPs exerted modulatory effects on macrophage functions, which may contribute to developing novel approaches to treating inflammatory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 China Pharmaceutical University.
