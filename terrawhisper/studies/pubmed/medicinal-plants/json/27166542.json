This research assessed the total phenolic compounds and in vitro total antioxidant potentials of water extracts in selected species of Zingiberaceae rhizomes use as spice, drinks and medicine. DPPH and FRAP were used to determine the antioxidant capacity, total flavonoid, phenolic acids and polyphenol contents assays to evaluate the quality of the antioxidant activity and the control was ascorbic acid. The results showed that all extracts contain significant antioxidant activity with Zingiber officinale having the highest activity in all assays. DPPH (222.30mg/TE/g DW), FRAP (98.04mg/TE/g DW), Flavonoid (38.58mg/NGN/g DW) phenolic acid (10.78mg/GAE/g DW) and polyphenols (22.84mg/GAE/g DW). Significant and positive linear correlation were found in DPPH, FRAP and total flavonoid, phenolic acids and polyphenol contents. This study reveals some phytochemicals present in Zingiberaceae species, which might be responsible for their biological activities and reason for it use in folkloric medicine in Southeast Asia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University Putra Malaysia UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Adekoya", "ForeName": "Alafiatayo Akinola", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University Putra Malaysia UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Syahida", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University Putra Malaysia UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Maziah", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Folklore"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27166542"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
