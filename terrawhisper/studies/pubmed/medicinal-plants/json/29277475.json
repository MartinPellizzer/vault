Humans are the major target for the pneumococcus. The pneumococcus is a common etiological agent of many different diseases such as bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, otitis media (OM), sinusitis, and conjunctivitis. According to the WHO, the pneumococcus is responsible for causing 1 million deaths each year. In 2000, over 14 million children worldwide under the age of 5 years were diagnosed with a pneumococcal disease, with the highest incidence seen in Africa. The human population most susceptible to pneumococcal infections is that of children due to their immature immune system. A sensational increase in antibiotic resistance among S. pneumoniae has been witnessed in different parts of the world since 1980s. The increase of resistance of S. pneumoniae to antibiotics is of major concern throughout the world. Worldwide, there are concerns about rising levels of antibiotic resistance and fears that the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy may be compromised, resulting in treatment failure and reduced utility of older antibiotics, a comparatively novel method has been used to defeat the resistant pathogens since last decade. The computational subtractive genomics approach is one of them, in which the bacterial pathogen complete proteins is gradually rock-bottom to a small number of likely drug targets. In this approach the steps which are used to find human non-homologs targets, proteins that are essential to the disease causing agent and participation of the selected proteins in pathogen metabolic pathways which are necessary for the survival of bacteria. We used computational subtractive genomics on consummate proteins of the of S. pneumonia strain JJA in this study and concluded with 2 proteins that can be used as potent drug targets against which new dynamic molecules can be planned to make better the action to treat the disease which is related with pathogen."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
