The term \"TCMs\" both represents to the single drug agent like Salvia miltiorrhiza, Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis, and those herbal formulas like Jingshu Keli, Wenxin Keli and Danzhen powder. In recent years, the researches of TCMs developed rapidly to understand the scientific basis of these herbs. In this review, we collect the studies of TCM and their containing bioactive compounds, and attempt to provide an overview for their regulatory effects on different ion channels including Ca2+, K+, Na+, Cl- channels and TRP, P2X receptors. The following conditions are used to limit the range of our review. (i) Only the herbal materials are included in this review and the animal- and mineral-original TCMs are excluded. (ii) The major discussions in this review focus on single TCM agent and the herbal formulas are only discussed for a little. (iii) Those most famous herbal medicines like Capsicum annuum (pepper), Curcuma longa (ginger) and Cannabis sativa (marijuana) are excluded. (iv) Only those TCM herbs with more than 5 research papers confirming their effects on ion channels are discussed in this review. Our review discusses recently available scientific evidences for TCMs and related bioactive compounds that have been reported with the modulatory effects on different ion channels, and thus provides a new ethnopharmacological approach to understand the usage of TCMs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shumei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Renjie", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cell Asymmetry, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of CNS Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima 771-0192, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of New Drug and Pharmaceutical Process, Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Shanghai 200437, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Professional and Technical Service Center for Biological Material Drug-ability Evaluation, Shanghai 200437, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269155", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30370864", "10.2174/1871527317666181026165400", "CNSNDDT-EPUB-94039"]}}]}
