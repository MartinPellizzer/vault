Br. and its mechanism of anti-angiogenesis effect.", "MTT assay and ELISA were used to detect the proliferation and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, ovarian neoplasm SKOV3, colon carcinoma HT-29 and bladder cancer T24 cell lines respectively. The expression of fetal liver kinase (Flk-1) protein and mRNA in endothelial cells induced by VEGF was analyzed by Western blotting and RT-PCR.", "The ethyl acetate part of alcohol extract from seeds of Livistona chinensis R. Br. could selectively inhibit the proliferation of HT-29 and T24 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, the maximum inhibitory rate were 74.66% and 86.52%, and could significantly inhibit the secretion of VEGF protein of the four tumor cell lines. The petroleum ether part had similar inhibitory effect as well as the ethyl acetate part, but its potency was inferior to the ethyl acetate part, the maximum inhibitory rate were 43.80% and 38.67%, the water-soluble and n-butanol parts had no effect on different tumor cell lines. The ethyl acetate part could reduce significantly the expression of Flk-1 protein and mRNA of HUVEC induced by VEGF.", "The ethyl acetate part, which is considered as active part of alcohol extract from seeds of Livistona chinensis R.
