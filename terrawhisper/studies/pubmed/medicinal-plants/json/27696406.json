The effect of these root extracts on cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax and p53) were also examined.", "Cytotoxic activity of root extracts was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Expression levels of apoptosis-related gene were analysed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. \u0394\u03a8m was examined by the use of JC-1 reagent.", "Rhaponticum carthamoides root extracts inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in human glioma cells. The root extracts were found to up-regulate the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and down-regulate the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, consequently increasing the ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 protein levels. Moreover, an increase of the p53 protein level and reduction of \u0394\u03a8m in glioma cells were observed after treatment with NR and TR extracts.", "The results of this study may offer a new insight into the potential anticancer activity of R. carthamoides root extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Royal Pharmaceutical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
