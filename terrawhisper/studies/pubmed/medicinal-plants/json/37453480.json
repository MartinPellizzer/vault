Medicinal plant-derived compounds against pathogenic bacteria may provide new, simple approaches to developing more environmentally friendly antimicrobial agents. Many researchers focus on exploring novel or combined strategies for combating bacterial resistance. Aromatic plants containing essential oils, such as basil, are often used as therapeutic agents in the pharmaceutical industry. Recent research has shown that basil is effective against certain harmful food phytopathogenic bacteria and has antimicrobial and anti-quorum sensing properties, which were investigated in this study. Our results have shown that the essential oil and ethanol extract of basil exhibits both antibacterial activity and anti-quorum sensing activity against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. It has also been found to have antifungal effects on C. albicans. Among the tested microorganisms, the genotypes of PI 531396, PI 296390, PI 414199, PI 253157, PI 296391, PI 652071, midnight, and Dino cultivars have been found to be more effective than other genotypes. The highest effect on quorum sensing system was found in Moonlight and Dino cultivars, PI 296391, PI 414199, PI 652070, PI 172997 and PI 190100 genotypes. Dendrogram analysis has shown that there is a relationship between different genotypes depending on microorganisms and anti-quorum sensing activity. Ames 29184, PI 207498, and PI 379412 genotypes were in the same group. Biplot analyses were performed to determine the relationship between the studied properties, and the results showed that more than 47% of the total variation was in all forms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
