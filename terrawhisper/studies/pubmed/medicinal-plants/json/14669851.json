ACE activity was measured in serum, kidney and lung. These data were compared with normal saline-treated rats. Histological scoring of renal cortical pathology was performed on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.", "Treatment of rats with gentamicin resulted in renal damage evidenced by proteinuria, polyuria, and decreased creatinine clearance. The damage to the kidney proximal tubule was evident by (a) the histological analysis at light microscopy and (b) the augmentation in the urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). Kidney ACE activity decreased while lung and serum ACE activity didn't change until day 7. Lung ACE activity increased significantly on day 7. Kidney and serum ACE activity increased too. Blood pressure increased significantly on day 7. This corresponded well with the lung ACE activity increment.", "These data suggest that kidney ACE activity decreased significantly just one day after gentamicin administration and prior to kidney NAG decrease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medicinal Plants ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziai", "ForeName": "Seyed Ali", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehian", "ForeName": "Pirooz", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahmoudian", "ForeName": "Massoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ren Fail", "NlmUniqueID": "8701128", "ISSNLinking": "0886-022X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.15.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy, Needle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Tubular Necrosis, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14669851", "10.1081/jdi-120026027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
