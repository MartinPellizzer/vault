Here, we report that RTHF inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells and is a potential strategy for cancer therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A431 cells were cultured in different concentrations of RTHF. The inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was shown through FCM, and cell invasion was assessed by Transwell methods. Enzyme proteasome assay was used to detect the activity of proteasome and DUB. Expression of apoptosis-related and ubiquitin proteasome pathway-associated proteins were assessed by PCR and Western blot. RESULTS RTHF obviously suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis of A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Transwell assay showed that RTHF inhibited the cell metastasis significantly. Enzyme proteasome assay show that the RTHF treatment of activity of proteasome and DUB was significantly lower than in control. RTHF increased the expression of Bax and inhibited Bcl-2, pro-caspase3, and pro-caspase9 activity. The expression of USP14, UCHL5, and POH1 decreased and ub-prs increased significantly in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals that RTHF-mediated inhibition of DUBs and proteasome may provide a potential strategy for cancer therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Liangrui", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiaohong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Third People's Hospital in Hangzhou Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yiping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Third People's Hospital in Hangzhou Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jianzhong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9609063", "ISSNLinking": "1234-1010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "BCL2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.19.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 9"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.25.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S2V45N7G3B", "NameOfSubstance": "flavone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Invasiveness"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interests</b>.
