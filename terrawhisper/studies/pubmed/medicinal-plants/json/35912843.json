However, OA is quite insoluble and thus inconvenient to be efficiently delivered in vivo. In this work, OA was fabricated into nanoparticles to generate OA elastic nanoparticles (OA-ENPs) with a particle size of 185.6\u2009nm and good stability in various physiological media. OA-ENPs alone achieved a high tumor inhibition rate of 60.3% without significant side effect. More surprisingly, the resultant OA-ENPs displayed dose-dependent tumor targetability. Low dose of OA-ENPs (10\u2009mg/kg) mainly distributed in the liver after intravenous injection, while high dose of OA-ENPs mainly distributed in tumor. At the high dose of 90\u2009mg/kg, OA-ENPs accumulation in tumor reached nearly twice as that in the liver. Here we provide a simple but effective way to achieve excellent tumor targetability without the need of any surface modification of nanoparticles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Jingxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Haowen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Likang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Meihua", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yifei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiangtao", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "9417471", "ISSNLinking": "1071-7544"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors report there are no competing interests to declare."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Alessenko AV, Burlakova EB.
