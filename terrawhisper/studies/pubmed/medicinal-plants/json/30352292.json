The structures of all compounds were elucidated by 1D/2D NMR, ESI-HRMS data and comparison with literature data. The relative configurations of the new compounds were defined by X-ray crystallography analysis, NOESY correlations and coupling constants. We evaluated their antibacterial efficacy against two commonly dispersed environmental strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and two pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to the standard antibiotics, streptomycin and gentamicin. Moreover, we assessed the antibacterial activity of the crude extract of the seeds in parallel to evaluate the plausible synergistic effects of the compounds in chemical defense of the seeds during germination and plant reproduction. The isolated compounds showed moderate antibacterial activities against the tested organisms. Compounds 1 and 3 and the crude extract exhibited distinct antibacterial activities against B. subtilis and S. aureus. The isolated compounds showed weak DPPH radical scavenging properties compared to the reference standard (Trolox). Our study lends evidence to the antibacterial chemical defense of S. staudtiana seeds by seed-borne compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
