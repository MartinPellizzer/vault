The most remarkable difference was found in the toxicity. The results indicate that the C3 hydroxy function of 1 participate in the induction of toxicity rather than of analgesia. 8-O-Linoleoyl-14-anisoylaconine (5), 8-O-methyl-14-anisoylaconine (7), 8-O-ethyl-14-anisoylaconine (8), 14-anisoylaconine (4) and 8-deoxy-14-anisoylaconine (9) showed lower activities than jesaconitine-induced analgesia and toxicity. The analgesic activity of 7 was almost the same as that of 8, but the toxicity of 7 was lower than that of 8. The analgesic activity of 9 was lower than that of 4, but the toxicities of both derivatives were not apparent. These facts indicate that the C8 function of 1 is important to the induction of analgesia and toxicity, and also that this function participates differently in the induction of the analgesia and toxicity. Subsequently, it was suggested that substituents at C3 and C8 of 1 played important roles of the induction of the analgesia and toxicity, and that the modes of this participation were not the same in analgesia and toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Section, Sanwa Shoyaka Co., Ltd., Utsunomya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murayama", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bando", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawahara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8AR7G4VMN4", "NameOfSubstance": "jesaconitine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X8YN71D5WC", "NameOfSubstance": "Aconitine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2054861", "10.1248/cpb.39.379"]}}]}
