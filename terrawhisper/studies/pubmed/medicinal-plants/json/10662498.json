LOX inactivation was described accurately assuming a first-order reaction. In the entire pressure-temperature domain studied (200 to 700 MPa and -10 to 60 degrees C), an increase in pressure at constant temperature enhanced the LOX inactivation rate, whereas at constant pressure, an increase in reaction rate was obtained by either increasing or decreasing temperature at 20 degrees C. At elevated pressure, LOX exhibited the greatest stability around 20 degrees C. Also the pressure dependence of the inactivation rate constants for LOX was the highest around 20 degrees C. On the basis of the estimated LOX inactivation rate constants, an iso-rate contour diagram as a function of pressure and temperature was constructed, and an empirical mathematical model describing the combined pressure-temperature dependence of the LOX inactivation rate constants was formulated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Microbial Technology, Laboratory of Food Technology, Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Indrawati", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Loey", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludikhuyze", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hendrickx", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10662498", "10.1021/bp9901419", "bp9901419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
