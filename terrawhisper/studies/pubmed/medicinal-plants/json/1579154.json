Adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) in the brain (B), liver (L) and kidneys (K) organs of alloxanized rats was significantly lowered compared with the negative control. On the other hand, adenosine-5-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) contents in the same organs were elevated markedly. In this connection myokinase activity in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions of B, L and K organs was stimulated at control. Also, the activities of some fundamental enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway i.e. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) and 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions of the same organs were markedly increased. Administration of Sammo at low and high levels reduced the consumption of ATP in B, L and K organs relative to positive control. Whereas, ADP and AMP contents were relatively reduced. Also, myokinase activity in the same organs were relatively inhibited. The activity of G-6-PD and 6-PGD in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions of the same organs were also decreased relative to the positive control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Rahim", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "el-Saadany", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abo-Eytta", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wasif", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "415SHH325A", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Monophosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.43", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.49", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Monophosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pentose Phosphate Pathway"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1579154", "10.1002/food.19920360103"]}}]}
