Also, we will attempt to identify small chemical metabolites that might be responsible for such anti-glucotoxicity effects.", "Firstly, the protective effect of 26 different Lespedeza species against MGO-induced toxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was investigated. The chemical metabolites of the most potent species (Lespedeza bicolor 1 (LB1) were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS), then quantified by HPLC. The effects of LB1 on MGO-induced apoptosis were measured by annexin V-FITC staining and western blot. Inhibitory effects of LB1 on MGO-induced ROS generation, and effect of LB1 on advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibitor or a glycated cross-link breaker are also measured.", "Among different Lespedeza species, LB1 extract was shown to reduce intracellular reactive oxidative species, exhibit anti-apoptotic effects, strongly inhibit all the mitogen-activated protein kinase signals, inhibit MGO-induced AGEs formation, and break down preformed AGEs. We tentatively identified 17 chemical constituents of LB1 by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Among those, some components, such as genistein and quercetin, significantly reduced the AGEs formation and increased the AGEs-breaking activity, resulting in the reduction of glucotoxicity.", "LB1 extract has shown to be effective in preventing or treating MGO-induced endothelial dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
