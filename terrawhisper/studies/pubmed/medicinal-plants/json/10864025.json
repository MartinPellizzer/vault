The structures of 1 and 2 have been determined by NMR, MS spectroscopic and chemical means. Compound 1 was converted into its methyl ester form (5) during the purification step, when the lactone ring was cleaved by catalysis of silica gel with the CHCl3-MeOH-H2O as a solvent. On the other hand, 1 was obtained in a high yield by the same purification procedure without MeOH. Based on this fact, a simple and economic method for the purification of 1 was confirmed. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to have a hepatoprotective effect on liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride in primary cultured rat hepatocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "X M", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "N Y", "Initials": "NY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irino", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shoyama", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10864025", "10.1248/bpb.23.731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
