Phytosterols, quercetin, gallic acid ethyl ester and geraniin were identified in P. caroliniensis on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR spectral data and by mixed co-TLC and co-HPLC injection with authentic samples. The HE of P. caroliniensis (10-100 mg kg-1, i.p.) inhibited, in a dose-related manner, acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions in mice, with a mean ID50 value of 23.7 mg kg-1. In the formalin test, the HE given intraperitoneally (1-30 mg kg-1) or orally (25-600 mg kg-1) caused graded inhibitions of both the neurogenic (first phase) and the inflammatory response (late phase) of formalin-induced licking. The HE was 54-fold more effective in inhibiting the late phase than it was in inhibiting the first phase of the formalin test, with mean ID50 values of 3.6 and 196.4 mg kg-1, respectively. The HE failed, however, to affect the oedematogenic response associated with the late phase of formalin-induced pain. In addition, the reference drug, aspirin, given intraperitoneally (1-100 mg kg-1) or orally (100-600 mg kg-1), caused significant inhibition of the late but not the first phase of the formalin test. Pharmacological analysis also revealed that quercetin, gallic acid ethyl ester and a semi-purified fraction of flavonoids (1-100 mg kg-1, i.p.) exhibited graded and significant antinociception against acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction. The mean ID50 values (mg kg-1) for these effects were: 18.8, 34.7 and 5.3, respectively. It is concluded that quercetin, gallic acid ethyl ester and some as yet unidentified flavonoids might account for the antinociceptive action reported for the HE of P. caroliniensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "N\u00facleo de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es Qu\u00edmico-Farmac\u00eauticas-NIQFAR/FAQFAR, Universidade do Vale do Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Cechinel Filho", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Campos", "ForeName": "R O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miguel", "ForeName": "O G", "Initials": "OG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ferrari", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Messana", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9004183", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1996.tb03928.x"]}}]}
