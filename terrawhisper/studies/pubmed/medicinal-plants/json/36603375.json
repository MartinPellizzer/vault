Herein, we attempted to design a potent multi-epitope vaccine for LCMV using immunoinformatics methods.", "The whole proteome of the virus was screened and mapped to extract immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes which were fused with appropriate linkers (EAAAK, GGGS, AAY, GPGPG, and AAY), PADRE sequence (13aa) and an adjuvant (50\u00a0S ribosomal protein L7/L12) to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine ensemble. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning of the constructed vaccine were carried out using bioinformatics tools. The secondary and tertiary structure of the vaccine construct was predicted and refined. The physicochemical profile of the designed vaccine was analyzed, and the multi-epitope vaccine's potential to bind Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) was evaluated through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Computational immune simulation of the designed vaccine antigen was performed using the C-ImmSim server.", "The designed multi-epitope-based vaccine (613 aa) comprised 26 immunodominant (six B-cell, nine cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and 11 helper T lymphocytes) epitopes and is predicted antigenic, non-toxic, non-allergen, soluble, and topographically accessible with a suitable physicochemical profile. The designed vaccine is expected to cover a broad worldwide population (96.35 %) and stimulate a robust adaptive immune response against the virus upon administration. In silico cloning of the constructed vaccine in PET28a (+) vector ensured its optimal expression in the Escherichia coli system. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy estimation collectively support the stability and energetically favourable interaction of the modeled vaccine-TLR2/4 complexes.", "The designed multi-epitope vaccine in the present study could serve as a potential vaccine candidate to protect against LMCV infection; however, the experimental validation and safety testing of the vaccine is warranted to validate the study's outcomes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
