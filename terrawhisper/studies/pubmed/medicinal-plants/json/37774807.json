In this study, we meticulously assembled the complete mitochondrial genome of A. tatarinowii using a combination of Illumina short reads and Oxford Nanopore long reads. Our findings revealed that A. tatarinowii possesses a complex chromosomal structural mitogenome, comprising two linear chromosomes and seven circular chromosomes. This mitogenome spans 1.81\u00a0Mb in length with a GC content of 38.29\u00a0%. Notably, it contained 24 unique mitochondrial core genes, seven unique variable genes, 17 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes. Analyses of codon usage, most protein-coding genes (PCGs) exhibited a common codon usage preference, with RSCU values greater than 1, and the codon with the highest RSCU value was UAA(End, 1.90). We conducted a thorough analysis of repeat sequences, the distribution of repetitive sequences in nine mitochondrial chromosomes showed distinct patterns. Moreover, we identified 82 and 12 homologous fragments by comparing the sequences of chloroplast and nuclear genomes to the A. tatarinowii mitogenome, respectively. Lastly, We predicted a total of 234 potential RNA editing sites in 28 unique PCGs and discovered that the nad4 gene has been edited the most often, at 26 times. Our results contribute to the enrichment of mitochondrial genome resources for Acoraceae, and the mitogenome also can be used as a reference for other species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
