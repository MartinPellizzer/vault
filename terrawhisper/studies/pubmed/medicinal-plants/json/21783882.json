We aimed to evaluate the effect of CGA on the protection from apoptosis by methylmercury (MeHg) in PC12 cells. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry detection. Caspase-3 activity was measured by confocal microscopy. Intracellular GSH levels were determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by means of chloromethyl-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined by UV. In order to elucidate the action of CGA, the protective effects of CGA were compared to Vit.E. CGA was effective at protecting PC12 cells against MeHg-induced damage in dose-dependent manner. CGA not only suppressed the generation of ROS, the decrease of activity in GPx and the decrease of GSH, but also attenuated caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells by MeHg. CGA eventually protected PC12 cells against MeHg-induced apoptosis. The results highlighted that CGA may exert neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant actions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100083, PR China; School of Public Health, Jilin Medical College, Jilin 132013, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongjin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yindong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xuefeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chunmei", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hongbo", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Changwen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21783882", "10.1016/j.etap.2007.12.008", "S1382-6689(08)00002-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
