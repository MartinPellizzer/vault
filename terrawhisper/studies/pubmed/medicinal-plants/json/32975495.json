The major problem in such device, is however limited power production due to slow kinetic of oxygen reduction at cathode. It is worthwhile to develop new materials that fulfil these requirements. The polymerization of aniline onto carbon cloth for effective electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticles has been carried out by chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. Three materials were thus elaborated, namely pristine carbon cloth, carbon cloth modified with platinum and carbon cloth modified by polymerization of aniline for immobilization of Pt-nanoparticles. The FTIR spectroscopy analysis revealed characteristic band located in 1720-1650\u2005cm<sup>-1</sup>, attributed to imine function, main component in skeleton of polymer PANI chain. The modified materials have been utilized as cathode in cell inoculated with medicinal plant wastes for improvement of oxygen reduction. Modified cathode with CC-PANI-Pt proved higher performances in all respects: increase of cell voltage from 338 to 765\u2005mV and power density from 862 to 1510\u2005mW/m<sup>2</sup> and abatement of COD of microbial inoculum leachate to 88%. Another feature of cell with modified cathode CC-PANI-Pt, was the enormous electric charge density harvested upon oxidation of 1\u2005mL of acetate 7.62\u2005C/cm<sup>2</sup> compared to that of cell with pristine CC cathode 0.54\u2005C/cm<sup>2</sup>. Nevertheless, coulombic efficiency for conversion of medicinal plant wastes into bioenergy was relatively lower 9%, making in evidence that elaborated electrochemical device was rather efficient and benificial environmentally than energetically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Electrochemistry of Metallic Complexes, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf Oran, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Zerrouki", "ForeName": "Aicha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoiry of Physico-Chemistry of Materials, Catalysis and Environnement, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf Oran, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Kameche", "ForeName": "Mostefa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Electrochemistry of Metallic Complexes, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf Oran, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Ait Amer", "ForeName": "Ahcene", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Electrochemistry of Metallic Complexes, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf Oran, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Tayeb", "ForeName": "Ahlem", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Electrochemistry of Metallic Complexes, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf Oran, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Moussaoui", "ForeName": "Douniazeed", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Institute of Membranes, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France."}], "LastName": "Innocent", "ForeName": "Christophe", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polyaniline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioelectric Energy Sources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32975495", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1829088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
