An induction (1.4 fold) of CYP 2E1 activity was observed at the higher dose of GbE treatment (P<0.01), but a reduction (1.9 fold) after Tan administration (P<0.01). Whereas GbE could induce CYP3A (1.6 fold) (P<0.01) but Tan had no effects. Furthermore, the activities of CYP 1A1 (5.6-8.9 fold) and 1A2 (2.6 fold) in the kidney were induced by GbE (P<0.01). The activity of GT in rat liver receiving Tan was significantly increased (P<0.05) and a dramatic reduction in the activity of GT in the kidney was observed in the GbE-treated group (P<0.01). In addition, the GbE treatment markedly decreased the levels of MDA and NO in the tissues of rats (P<0.01).", "The modulation of CYP isozymes by GbE and Tan may result in altered metabolism of coadministered drugs.
