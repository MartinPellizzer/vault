This enzyme, phospholipase D, was stable at 50 C in the presence of 5 mM DTT but was inactivated at 55 C. The enzyme was precipitated with cold acetone, concentrated between 30% saturation to 40% saturation with ammonium sulphate, absorbed on calcium phosphate gel and eluted with 0.2 M phosphate buffer. This procedure resulted in a 20-fold increase in specific activity. The activity of fababean phospholipase D was much higher when assayed at 38 C than that at room temperature. There was an obligatory requirement for calcium, and for maximal activity 40 mM calcium was required. A narrow pH optimum of about pH 5.7 was observed. The enzyme activity was extremely dependent on substrate dispersion. When 5 mM phosphatidylcholine (PC) was sonicated with increasing levels of sodium dodecyl sulphate (1 mM to 4 mM), the enzyme activity kept increasing. By using equimolar concentrations of PC and sodium dodecyl sulphate (1 mM to 5 mM), the Michaelis constant (Km) was estimated to be 1.74 mM. Addition of choline and serine at 10 mM concentration reduced phospholipase D activity by 31% and 22%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atwal", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eskin", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lipids", "NlmUniqueID": "0060450", "ISSNLinking": "0024-4201"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipase D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipase D"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bull Soc Chim Biol (Paris). 1968 Dec;50(9):1395-408", "ArticleIdList": ["5704367"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1962 Sep;84:497-501", "ArticleIdList": ["13884048"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1948 Jan;172(1):191-8", "ArticleIdList": ["18920784"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Biochem. 1970 Jun;48(6):643-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4988907"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1967 Jan;102(1):76-86", "ArticleIdList": ["6030303"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Biochem Physiol. 1954 Sep;32(5):571-83", "ArticleIdList": ["13190466"]}, {"Citation": "J Lipid Res. 1964 Jan;5:126-7", "ArticleIdList": ["14173318"]}, {"Citation": "Adv Lipid Res. 1978;16:267-326", "ArticleIdList": ["362867"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1956 Jan;218(1):213-24", "ArticleIdList": ["13278329"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 1963 May;113:91-4", "ArticleIdList": ["14028403"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["41998", "10.1007/BF02533505"]}}]}
