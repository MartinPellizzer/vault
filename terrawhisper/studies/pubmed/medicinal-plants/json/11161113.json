In this study, large amounts of a recombinant plant PLD alpha were secreted into the culture medium of baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified to homogeneity in the form of a fully active enzyme. The transient production of recombinant PLD alpha yielded a protein (rPLD alpha a, 88 kDa) together with a shorter form (rPLD alpha b, 87 kDa), which accumulated in the medium. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing of the rPLD alpha a and rPLD alpha b showed that rPLD alpha b resulted from proteolytic cleavage at Gly8-Ile9. Immunoblotting showed that both rPLD alpha a and rPLD alpha b are recognized by a polyclonal antibody previously raised against native soybean PLD alpha. One-step calcium-dependent octyl-Sepharose chromatography was used to obtain the two highly purified forms of rPLD alpha, as attested by gel electrophoresis, N-terminal amino acid sequence and mass spectrometry. The N-terminal region of PLD alpha is homologous with the C2 domains which are present in a number of enzymes known to be involved in signal transduction and/or phospholipid metabolism. The truncated rPLD alpha b lacks the first acidic amino acid in its N-terminus, which is probably involved in the calcium binding site. The rPLD alpha b was thus easily eluted from the octyl-Sepharose column by decreasing the calcium concentration of the buffer from 50 to 30 mM, whereas, the rPLD alpha a was eluted after chelating calcium ions with EDTA. The purified rPLD alpha yield reached a level of 10 mg per liter of serum-free culture medium. The availability of baculovirus-derived rPLD alpha constitutes a valuable source of enzyme for future crystallographic studies to determine its three-dimensional structure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UPR 9025 du CNRS, Laboratoire de Lipolyse Enzymatique, 31 Chemin Joseph-Aiguier, 13402 Marseille Cedex 20, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El Maarouf", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carri\u00e8re", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivi\u00e8re", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abousalham", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Protein Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "8801484", "ISSNLinking": "0269-2139"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipase D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipase D"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spodoptera"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11161113", "10.1093/protein/13.11.811"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
