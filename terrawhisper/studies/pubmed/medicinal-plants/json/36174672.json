This study looks at plasma proteome in migraine patients for potential protein biomarkers.", "This case-control study has two phases. In phase I, plasma samples were collected from three groups, including twenty-three episodic migraineurs, thirty-five chronic migraineurs, and twenty-nine healthy subjects. In phase II, plasma samples were prepared from two groups, including five episodic and five chronic migraine cases, during the pain and 24\u00a0h after the pain-free periods. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed on plasma proteins. The possible corresponding proteins for the differentially expressed spots between groups investigated by the Melanie software were predicted by 2-DE gels of the EXPASY database. LC-MS/MS additionally analyzed phase II data.", "Expression levels of haptoglobin, clusterin, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen beta chain, complement c3, transthyretin, \u03b11-microglobulin, and retinol-binding protein 4 were shown considerable changes in migraine patients compared to controls or their pain-free period.", "Differences in expression levels for several proteins were observed across groups. Most of these are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroprotection, which can be considered potential disease biomarkers. However, further research is necessary for this respect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
