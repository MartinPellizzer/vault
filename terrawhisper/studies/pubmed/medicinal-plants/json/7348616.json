The technology is based on a low-cost extruder cooker (LEC). The primary products are 1) vitamin- and mineral-fortified cereal/legume blends for use in supplementary feeding programmes, and 2) protein supplements for fortifying cereal and/or root crop foods. Plants have been installed in four developing countries, and research and development activities are being carried out in a number of others. The programme involves agricultural and industrial development as well as nutritional improvement. The major product currently made is CSB, and in some cases CSM made by blending dried milk with CSB. These products have been demonstrated to be safe, nutritious and acceptable by the target population, although more work is needed on expanding the ways in which the blended foods might be used in traditional recipes, as well as in gruels and porridges."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jansen", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harper", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Food Nutr (Roma)", "NlmUniqueID": "7512731", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8942"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Requirements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7348616"]}}]}
