Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors have been widely used to treat patients with AD. In the present study, we investigated anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities of a natural product, WC, for its potential applications in therapies to prevent/treat dementia.", "First, compounds extracted from WC were tested for their AChE and BChE inhibitory activities in vitro. Second, in vivo behavioral experiments were performed to investigate the effects of WC at doses of 100, 150, and 200mg/kg on scopolamine (1.5mg/kg)-induced memory and cognitive deficits in mice. The behavior of mice treated with and without WC and/or scopolamine was tested using the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition task.", "The results of the in vitro assay demonstrated anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities of the compounds extracted from WC. The results of behavioral experiments showed that the administration of WC prevented 1) scopolamine-induced decrease in spontaneous alternation (%) behavior in the Y-maze, 2) scopolamine-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze, and 3) scopolamine-induced deficits in novel object recognition. These results indicate that WC prevents cognitive and memory deficits induced by scopolamine injection.", "Our findings suggest that WC may represent a novel candidate for the treatment of memory and cognitive deficits in humans with dementia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
