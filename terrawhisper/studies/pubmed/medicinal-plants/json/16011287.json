Hypertensive rats were randomly allocated into model group, Enalapril group and TGR group, and the drugs were used for 6 weeks continuously. During this period, the blood pressure of rats was measured every two weeks. After rats were sacrificed, the wet weight, tissue Ang II level of LV and aorta, and the cardiac index were measured.", "One week after renovascular stenosis, the systolic blood pressure (SPS) of model group was increased by 37.4 mmHg, and 7 weeks after stenosis, the LV and aortic hypertrophy was obvious increased, meanwhile, tissue Ang II of LV and aorta was raised markedly (P < 0.01). Contrasting with the model group, blood pressure was reduced and the morphological index was improved in Enalapril group respectively (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); the wet weight of LV and aorta were reduced, the morphological index was improved, the rise of Ang II in tissue was suppressed, in TGR group significantly.", "TGR can attenuate myocardial and aorta hypertrophy induced by renovascular hypertension, and suppress the rise of Ang II in tissue significantly. This suggests that TGR has the effects on interfering LV and aortic hypertrophy by an independent-antihypertensive way."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geriatrics Institute, Xiyuan hospital, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100091, China. dq_wang96@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan-Qiao", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "De-Zhong", "Initials": "DZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Gui-You", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tianma gouteng"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11128-99-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "69PN84IO1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Enalapril"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enalapril"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Renovascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Uncaria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16011287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
