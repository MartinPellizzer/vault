As part of a wider program investigating Bhutanese medicinal plants,.we have previously identified eight isoquinoline alkaloids from C. dubia. Out of these, we report here on two of the major alkaloids, scoulerine (1) and cheilanthifoline (2) and their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE),-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti TNF-\u03b1) and a bacteial strain, Helicobacterpylori. Both alkaloids showed weak anti TNF-\u03b1 and antibacterial activities. However, the anti-AChE activity of scoulerine (1) was promising as it-significantly inhibited AChE with a minimum inhibitory requirement (MIR) value of 0.0015 nmol, which was two-fold better than the reference drug, galanthamine (MIR value of 0.003 nmol). As there are limited.anti-Alzheimer's chemotherapeutics, scoulerine (1) is worthy of further exploration, including lead optimization, structure-activity-relationship studies, analog development,.pharmacodynanics and in vivo animal studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wangchuk", "ForeName": "Phurpa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sastraruji", "ForeName": "Thanapat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taweechotipatr", "ForeName": "Malai", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pyne", "ForeName": "Stephen G", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "THP-1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30508337"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
