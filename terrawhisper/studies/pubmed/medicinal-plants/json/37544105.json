The majority of conventional detection methods for CTCs rely on the recognition of epithelial biomarkers, which is technically challenging for detecting CTCs with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced phenotypic alteration. In this work, we have constructed a label-free biosensor for sensitive electrochemical assay of mCTCs. In our design, the capture probe can recognize the vimentin overexpressed on the surface of mCTCs with high specificity. Meantime, the network-like DNA nanoprobes with multiple G-quadruplex/hemin complexes and multiple cholesterol molecules can be grafted to the cell surface based on the high affinity between cholesterol molecules and cell membrane. Owing to the mimic horseradish peroxidase of G-quadruplex/hemin complexes, strong electrochemical responses will be obtained for sensitive quantification of mCTCs with a detection limit of 8\u00a0cell mL<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the biosensor can effectively overcome the interference of vimentin negative cells or secretory vimentin, and realize the recovery tests in whole blood with high accuracy, thereby may further promoting the diagnosis and personalized treatment of cancer in clinic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
