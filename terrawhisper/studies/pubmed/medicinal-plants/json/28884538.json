As a traditional herbal medicine, medicine mulberry with high levels of secondary metabolites has important values of scientific research and utilization. In order to solve the introduction problems for medicine mulberry, we have established its rapid propagation system through tissue culture since 2011. The shoots of medicine mulberry through tissue culture were transplanted into the field to carry out an introduction experiment. Here, we firstly reported that the growth status and pest and disease occurrence of medicine mulberry in the field of Chongqing and found that the medicine mulberry through tissue culture had well-developed root system, it showed better growth than medicine mulberry by grafting technique, and Pseudodendrothrips moil was a major pest of medicine mulberry. The introduction technique for medicine mulberry established successfully in this study could lay the foundation for large-scale cultivation and high efficiency utilization of medicine mulberry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Qi-Wei", "Initials": "QW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Sericultural Research Institute of Xinjiang, Hetian 848000, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Tian-Long", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ai-Chun", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Huai", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ning-Jia", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28884538", "10.4268/cjcmm20160814"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
