However, a precise mechanism of action (MOA) has not been identified. Systems pharmacology methods have been used to overcome these challenges. However, there is a limitation as those similar mechanisms of similar components cannot be identified. In this study, comparisons of physicochemical descriptors, molecular docking analysis and RNA-seq analysis were performed to compare the MOA of similar compounds and to confirm the changes observed when similar compounds were mixed and used. Various analyses have confirmed that compounds with similar structures share similar MOA. We propose an advanced method for in silico experiments in herbal medicine research based on the results. Our study has three novel findings. First, an advanced network pharmacology research method was suggested by partially presenting a solution to the difficulty in identifying multi-component mechanisms. Second, a new natural product analysis method was proposed using large-scale molecular docking analysis. Finally, various biological data and analysis methods were used, such as in silico system pharmacology, docking analysis and drug response RNA-seq. The results of this study are meaningful in that they suggest an analysis strategy that can improve existing systems pharmacology research analysis methods by showing that natural product-derived compounds with the same scaffold have the same mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
