The present investigation was carried out to establish its in vivo anti-inflammatory activity using several animal models of inflammation and pain. The 75% ethanol extract of the aerial part of E. splendens significantly inhibited mouse croton oil-induced, as well as arachidonic acid-induced, ear edema by oral administration (44.6% inhibition of croton oil-induced edema at 400 mg/kg). This plant material also showed significant inhibitory activity against the mouse ear edema induced by multiple treatment of phorbol ester for 3 days, which is an animal model of subchronic inflammation. In addition, E. splendens exhibited significant analgesic activity against mouse acetic acid-induced writhing (50% inhibition at 400 mg/kg), while indomethacin (5 mg/kg) demonstrated 95% inhibition. E. splendens (5-100 microg/mL) significantly inhibited PGE2 production by pre-induced cyclooxygenase-2 of lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 cells, suggesting that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition might be one of the cellular mechanisms of anti-inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong Wook", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Kun Ho", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hyeun Wook", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "KiHwan", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Sam Sik", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun Pyo", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12723937", "10.1007/BF02976835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
