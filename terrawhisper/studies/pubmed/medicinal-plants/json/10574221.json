At the stage of 2-wks' duration of diabetes, relaxation responses to lower concentrations of Ach in 0.3 uM phenylepherine-precontracted aortas were diminished significantly (P<0.05) compared with age-matched control, but the maximal relaxation of Ach remained unchanged. At the stage of 6-wks' duration, diabetes caused an approximately 60% (P<0.001) deficit in maximum relaxation, and this was significantly (P<0.001) prevented in AG and EB treated groups. There was an approximately 40% enhancement in the maximum contractile response to phenylepherine with diabetes (P<0.05), which was unaffected significantly by AG and EB treatments. The data suggest that the defective endothelium-dependent relaxation in diabetic rat aorta occurred as early as 2-wks' duration of diabetes, and the treatments of AG and EB could protect vascular endothelium although the deficits in vascular smooth muscle contractile responses were not protected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sun Yat-Sen University of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Y Y", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1WS297W6MV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylephrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Relaxation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylephrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10574221", "S0024320599004002"]}}]}
