North Alabama's climate is conducive to growing mint for essential oils used in culinary, confectionery, and medicinal purposes. There is, however, a need for varieties of <i>P. virginianum</i> that can be adapted and easily grown for production in North Alabama. Towards this end, four field-grown varieties with three harvesting times (M1H1, M1H2, M1H3; M2H1, M2H2, M2H3; M3H1, M3H2, M3H3, M4H1, M4H2, M4H3) were evaluated for relative differences in essential oil yield and composition. Thirty-day-old greenhouse-grown plants of the four varieties were transplanted on raised beds in the field at the Alabama A & M University Research Station in North Alabama. The plots were arranged in a randomized complete block with three replications. The study's objective was to compare the four varieties for essential oil yield and their composition at three harvest times, 135, 155, and 170 days after planting (DAP). Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation with continuous extraction with dichloromethane using a Likens-Nickerson apparatus and analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques. At the first harvest, the essential oil yield of the four varieties showed that M1H1 had a yield of 1.15%, higher than M2H1, M3H1, and M4H1 with 0.91, 0.76, and 1.03%, respectively. The isomenthone concentrations increased dramatically through the season in M1 (M1H1, M1H2, M1H3) by 19.93, 54.7, and 69.31%, and M3 (M3H1, M3H2, M3H3) by 1.81, 48.02, and 65.83%, respectively. However, it increased only slightly in M2 and M4. The thymol concentration decreased slightly but not significantly in all four varieties; the thymol in M2 and M4 was very high compared with M1 and M3. The study showed that mountain mint offers potential for production in North Alabama. Two varieties, M1 and M3, merit further studies to determine yield stability, essential oil yield, composition, and cultivation development practices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3639-0528"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic Plant Research Center, 230 N 1200 E, Suite 100, Lehi, UT 84043, USA."}], "LastName": "Setzer", "ForeName": "William N", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Alabama A & M University, Normal, AL 35762, USA."}], "LastName": "Duong", "ForeName": "Lam", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Alabama A & M University, Normal, AL 35762, USA."}], "LastName": "Pham", "ForeName": "Trang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic Plant Research Center, 230 N 1200 E, Suite 100, Lehi, UT 84043, USA."}], "LastName": "Poudel", "ForeName": "Ambika", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Cuong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Alabama A & M University, Normal, AL 35762, USA."}], "LastName": "Mentreddy", "ForeName": "Srinivasa Rao", "Initials": "SR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2015-38821-24337", "Agency": "National Institute of Food and Agriculture", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Plants (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101596181", "ISSNLinking": "2223-7747"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Moerman D.E.
