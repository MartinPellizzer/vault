Moreover, oxidative stress plays an important role in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. The current study aimed to explore the antioxidant and protective effects of Pimpinella anisum (P. anisum) on the alleviation of GM-induced damage.", "Forty male wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, sham that was administrated normal saline orally and intraperitoneally (i.p.), GM that received 100\u00a0mg/kg bw/day\u00a0i.p., GM and ethanolic extract of P. anisum that was administrated at an oral dose of 300\u00a0mg/kg bw/day for 8 days. Creatinine, Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured. The levels of ferric-reducing-antioxidant-power (FRAP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to evaluate the oxidative stress induced by GM. Kidney tissues were stained to determine the degree of tissue damage.", "The plasma levels of creatinine, BUN, MDA and the absolute excretion of sodium and potassium were increased in the GM group, while FRAP level was reduced compared to the sham group. In addition, congestion of renal Vessels and tubular cell necrosis was observed. We found that 300\u00a0mg/kg bw/day P. anisum significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of renal function markers in the group receiving GM (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, gentamicin-induced tubule damage was improved by P. anisum.", "We demonstrated the potential therapeutic impact of P. anisum to attenuate GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the simultaneous use of ethanolic extract of P. anisum during GM administration is recommended to reduce its nephrotoxicity effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Changizi-Ashtiyani", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Student, Student Research Committee, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Seddigh", "ForeName": "Amirhassan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, University of Arak, Arak, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Houshang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional and Complementary Medicine Research Center (TCMRC), Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hossaini", "ForeName": "Nasser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Medicine Group, Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akbary", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Manian", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nedaeinia", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Nephrology (Carlton)", "NlmUniqueID": "9615568", "ISSNLinking": "1320-5358"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Nephrology (Carlton). 2017 Mar;22(3):268. doi: 10.1111/nep.13002", "PMID": "28205350"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pimpinella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27860049", "10.1111/nep.12953"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
