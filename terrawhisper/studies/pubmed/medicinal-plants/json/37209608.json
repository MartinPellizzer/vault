However, the in vivo anti-hyperuricemia effect and its underlying mechanism were still unknown.", "The current study aimed to evaluate the anti-hyperuricemia effect of \u03b1-viniferin in a mouse model and to assess its safety profile with emphasis on its protective effect on hyperuricemia-induced renal injury.", "The effects were assessed in a potassium oxonate (PO)- and hypoxanthine (HX)-induced hyperuricemia mice model by analyzing the levels of serum uric acid (SUA), urine uric acid (UUA), serum creatinine (SCRE), serum urea nitrogen (SBUN), and histological changes. Western blotting and transcriptomic analysis were used to identify the genes, proteins, and signaling pathways involved.", "\u03b1-Viniferin treatment significantly reduced SUA levels and markedly mitigated hyperuricemia-induced kidney injury in the hyperuricemia mice. Besides, \u03b1-viniferin did not show any obvious toxicity in mice. Research into the mechanism of action of \u03b1-viniferin revealed that it not only inhibited uric acid formation by acting as an XOD inhibitor, but also reduced uric acid absorption by acting as a GLUT9 and URAT1 dual inhibitor as well as promoted uric acid excretion by acting as a ABCG2 and OAT1 dual activator. Then, 54 differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub> FPKM \u2265 1.5, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) genes (DEGs) repressed by the treatment of \u03b1-viniferin in the hyperuricemia mice were identified in the kidney. Finally, gene annotation results revealed that downregulation of S100A9 in the IL-17 pathway, of CCR5 and PIK3R5 in the chemokine signaling pathway, and of TLR2, ITGA4, and PIK3R5 in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were involved in the protective effect of \u03b1-viniferin on the hyperuricemia-induced renal injury.", "\u03b1-Viniferin inhibited the production of uric acid through down-regulation of XOD in hyperuricemia mice. Besides, it also down-regulated the expressions of URAT1 and GLUT9 and up-regulated the expressions of ABCG2 and OAT1 to promote the excretion of uric acid. \u03b1-Viniferin could prevent hyperuricemia mice from renal damage by regulating the IL-17, chemokine, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Collectively, \u03b1-viniferin was a promising antihyperuricemia agent with desirable safety profile. This is the first report of \u03b1-viniferin as an antihyperuricemia agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH..
