This work evaluated the safety of F. gummosa root in pregnancy, lactation, and juvenile periods. This study was performed in three parts: (1) pregnant rats were received diet containing 0 (control), 150\u2009, or 700\u2009mg/kg of F. gummosa root during pregnancy; (2) Lactating rats were treated with diet containing the root (0, 150, or 700\u2009mg/kg) during lactation period; (3) juvenile rats were received 4 weeks diet containing the root (0, 150, or 700\u2009mg/kg). F. gummosa at both doses had no significant effects on the duration of pregnancy, maternal weight, and the number of delivered pups, but at dose of 700\u2009mg/kg decreased birthweight of the pups. In lactation period, F. gummosa had no significant effects on mortality, body weight, body length, the weight of organs, and blood biochemical parameters of offspring. In juvenile rats, food consumption, body weight, and WBCs number were decreased in treated groups. No histopathological lesions were detected in the brain, heart, liver, lungs and kidney of offspring, and juvenile rats in treated groups. LC/MS/MS analysis confirmed systemic absorption of active constituents of the root by the oral route of administration. In conclusion, F. gummosa root did not produce significant toxic effects during pregnancy, lactation, and juvenile period. But, decrease in birthweight of delivered pups and in weight gain of juvenile rats should be considered in the long-term consumption of this plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Health Promotion Research Center , Zahedan University of Medical Sciences , Zahedan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahedi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdian", "ForeName": "Davood", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafarian", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Biotechnology Research Center , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Basic Sciences , Esfarayen Faculty of Medical Sciences , Esfarayen , Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeilizadeh", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28678536", "10.1080/01480545.2017.1337126"]}}]}
