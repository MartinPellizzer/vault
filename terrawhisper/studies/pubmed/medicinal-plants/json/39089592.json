Medicinal products of Ammi majus seed, with sunlight exposure, are worldwide used for the treatment of vitiligo (pale-white patches on the skin). To increase the content of seed-coumarins and to investigate the physiological reasons in this respect, two net-house experiments were conducted using foliar-spray treatments (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) of salicylic acid (SA) (Experiment 1) and putrescine (PUT) (Experiment 2). All studied parameters were improved due to the foliar application of both growth elicitors (SA and PUT). The best outcomes for SA and PUT were obtained at 50\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> which maximally increased the growth characteristics, physiological and biochemical attributes, and seed quality parameters. In comparison to the control, 50\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of SA and PUT increased the chlorophyll content by 26.3% and 25.5%, carotenoid content by 31.4% and 18.5%. In addition 50\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of both SA and PUT gives the best results of FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer) & XRD (X-ray Diffraction) analysis. In GC-MS analysis, 50\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of SA and PUT increases the Methoxsalen content (17.44 and 16.81%) and 7H-Furo[3,2-g]. Bown (1995) [1] Benzopyran-7-one, 4,9-dimethoxy content(14.92 and 13.93%) and p-camphorene content (13.11 and 12.27%) in contrast to the control. Other important constituents were Pimpinellin (6.31 and 4.08%), Bergapten (8.72 and 6.220, Isospathulenol (7.80 and 2.47), Octadecenoic acid (5.78 and 3.59) and Vitamin E (1.48 and 0.16)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
