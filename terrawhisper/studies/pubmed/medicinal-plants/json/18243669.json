Results were found that the activities of SOD, CAT, POD and APX enhanced totally in different organs of D. candidum, as leaves, stems and roots, in response to the stress. Furthermore there happened similar shift of antioxidant enzymes activities, which increased in the initial stimulation and decreased afterwards. Data showed SOD, CAT, POD and APX activities ascended to max at day 9, 6, 9 and 12 in leaves, at day 9, 6, 12 and 9 in stems, and at day 12, 6, 9 and 9 in roots, respectively. As a lipid peroxidation parameter, MDA content in different organs increased in the beginning, dropped afterward, and increased again in the late. Anyway the total trend was the rise of MDA level compared to the control. It was interesting that the MDA content appeared the lowest levels almost when the antioxidant enzymes activities were up to the highest. Our results demonstrated the different organs of D. candidum might produce accumulation of active oxygen species (AOS) under initial treatment of sound wave stress. Later AOS might start to reduce due to the enhancement of antioxidant enzymes activities treated by the stress. The data revealed that the antioxidant metabolism was to be important in determining the ability of plants to survive in sound stress, and the up regulation of these enzymes activities would help to reduce the build up of AOS, which could protect plant cells from oxidative damage. Moreover, different cell compartments might activate different defensive system to reduce excessive amount of AOS. Finally the mechanism of this action was also discussed simply."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Bioinformation, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing 400065, China. cquptlibiao@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Jinmin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xiaolan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yilong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Kunxian", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bochu", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "9315133", "ISSNLinking": "0927-7765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sound"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18243669", "10.1016/j.colsurfb.2007.12.012", "S0927-7765(07)00489-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
