Chromatographic analysis led to the isolation of four new compounds, murranofuran A (1), murranolide A (2), murranopyrone (3a), and murranoic acid A (4a), along with six known metabolites, N-(2-hydroxy-6-methoxyphenyl)acetamide (5), curvularin (6), (S)-dehydrocurvularin (7), pyrenolide A (8), modiolide A (9), and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin (10). The structures of the known compounds were confirmed by comparing ESI HR mass spectra, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and optical rotation data with values reported in the literature. The planar structures of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive analysis of 1D and 2D NMR and mass data. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were established by coupling constant analysis, modified Mosher's method, and CD data. Compound 8 showed a strong motility impairing activity against Phytophthora capsici zoospores at a low concentration (100% at 0.5 \u03bcg/mL) in a short time (30 min). Compounds 2, 3a, 6, 7, 9, and 10 exhibited zoospore motility impairment activity at higher concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>: 50-100 \u03bcg/mL)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8495-4498"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen , Tamannstrasse 2, D-37077 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Mondol", "ForeName": "Muhammad Abdul Mojid", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University , Gazipur-1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Farthouse", "ForeName": "Jannatul", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University , Gazipur-1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Mohammad Tofazzal", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Drug Research , D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sch\u00fcffler", "ForeName": "Anja", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen , Tamannstrasse 2, D-37077 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Laatsch", "ForeName": "Hartmut", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isocoumarins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Murraya"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytophthora"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28195475", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00785"]}}]}
