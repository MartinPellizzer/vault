These mainly aromatic plants are used as essential oils, extracts or isolated components (polyphenols, phenolic compounds, terpenes, iridoids etc.). Some Labiatae species (more than 30, such as cornmint, lavender, patchouli, rosemary etc.) are famous for their use in essential oil production worldwide. In this review, cardioprotective effects of Lamiaceae and their active secondary metabolites, as well as mechanism of action against cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, angina pectoris, hyperlipidemia, thromboembolism, coronary heart disease, heart failure, venous insufficiency, arrhythmia) will be discussed. Use of Labiatae as food or food additives (such as spices) may prevent risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. This approach is also described as a part of the article. Studies on developing new, effective and safe natural products from Lamiaceae (rich source of flavonoids and other active compounds) are promising and may offer prevention and treatment for patients with coronary disease and other related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Campus of Food Science, Piazza Goidanich 60, 47521 Cesena, Italy."}], "LastName": "Patrignani", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Sahdeo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, Institute of Chemistry Technology and Metallurgy, Njegoseva 12, 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Novakovic", "ForeName": "Miroslav", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Botany and Botanical Garden, Jevremovac, Takovska 43, 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Marin", "ForeName": "Petar D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Botany and Botanical Garden, Jevremovac, Takovska 43, 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia, dankabukvicki@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Bukvicki", "ForeName": "Danka", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)", "NlmUniqueID": "101612996", "ISSNLinking": "2768-6698"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33049685", "10.2741/4909", "4909"]}}]}
