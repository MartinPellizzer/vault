This paper aimed to review literature reporting on herbs for lymphedema treatment.", "A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guideline. Clinical studies on herbal intervention and lymphedema were included. Evidence on the effectiveness of herbal interventions for desired outcomes including reduction of edema volume, other symptoms, quality of life and inflammation were collected and assessed in detail.", "In all twenty studies were included in this review. Of these 14 studies were randomized clinical trials and the rest were prospective pilot studies.
