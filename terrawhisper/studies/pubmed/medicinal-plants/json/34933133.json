Utilizing salt tolerance genes for the genetic breeding of crops is one of the most effective measures to withstand salinization. Sophora alopecuroides is a well-known saline-alkaline and drought-tolerant medicinal plant. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism for Sophora alopecuroides salt tolerance is crucial to identifying the salt-tolerant genes. In this study, we performed tandem mass tag (TMT) based proteomic profiling of S. alopecuroides leaves under 150\u00a0mM NaCl induced salt stress condition for 3 d and 7 d. Data are available on ProteomeXchange (PXD027627). Furthermore, the proteomic findings were validated through parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). We observed that the expression levels of several transporter proteins related to the secondary messenger signaling pathway were altered under salt stress conditions induced for 3 d. However, the expression of the certain transferase, oxidoreductase, dehydrogenase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, and amino acid metabolism, were mainly alerted after 7 d post-salt-stress induction. Several potential genes that might be involved in salt stress conditions were identified; however, it demands further investigation. Although salt stress affects the level of secondary metabolites, their correlation needs to be investigated further. SIGNIFICANCE: Salinization is the most severe abiotic adversity, which has had a significant negative effect on world food security over the time. Excavating salt-tolerant genes from halophytes or medicinal plants is one of the important measures to cope with salt stress. S. alopecuroides is a well-known medicinal plant with anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects, anti-saline properties, and resistance to drought stress. Currently, only a few studies have explored the S. alopecuroides' gene function, and regulation and these studies are mostly related to the unpublished genome sequence information of S. alopecuroides. Recently, transcriptomics and metabolomics studies have been carried on the abiotic stress in S. alopecuroides roots. Multiple studies have shown that altered gene expression at the transcript level and altered metabolite levels do not correspond to the altered protein levels. In this study, TMT and PRM based proteomic analyses of S. alopecuroides leaves under salt stress condition induced using 150\u00a0mM NaCl for 3 d and 7 d was performed. These analyses elucidated the activation of different mechanisms in response to salt stress. A total of 434 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in salt stress conditions were identified and analyzed. For the first time, this study utilized proteomics technology to dig out plentiful underlying salt-tolerant genes from the medicinal plant, S. alopecuroides. We believe that this study will be of great significance to crop genetics and breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
