Herbal medicines, or herbal supplements, are defined as any products originating from plants and used to preserve or recover health. In the United States, the popularity of herbal supplements has increased in the last several decades. Many physicians do not ask patients about herbal supplement use, and one-third of patients do not inform their physician about supplement use. However, physicians should ask, because although many supplements are considered low risk and safe, some have significant risks of adverse effects. For example, St John's wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>) can have significant drug interactions with prescription or over-the-counter drugs. The effectiveness of herbal supplements in the management of specific conditions varies. For some conditions, there is robust clinical data supporting the use of specific herbal supplements, but for other conditions there is poor or insufficient data. The content and safety of herbal supplements are the purview of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the FDA primarily responds to after-the-fact reports of postmarketing safety concerns. When an herbal supplement-related adverse effect is suspected, patients or physicians should report it to the FDA via the MedWatch reporting system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Written permission from the American Academy of Family Physicians is required for reproduction of this material in whole or in part in any form or medium."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "F.
