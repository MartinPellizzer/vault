The pigeon pea flours described in a previous publication were prepared from dehulled pigeon peas by cooking in autoclave, by extrusion-cooking and by cooking/dehydration by drum-drying. Mixtures of cooked pigeon peas and rice were first evaluated biological through a protein complementation design using NPR. The results of this study showed that the two products had high protein quality and were similar when mixed in ratios of 80:20 to 40:60. For the evaluation of the processed pigeon pea flour, mixtures with rice (80:20) were used. All pigeon pea flours gave similar protein quality values. On the basis of these results three products were developed and tested. One was a gruel (\"atole\"), a second a fruit-flavored thick drink with and without 15% milk. Cookies were also prepared with a series of blends of pigeon pea flour (extrusion-cooked) and wheat. The gruel and the fruit flavored products had high acceptability based on a sensory evaluation test. Cookies with 100% pigeon pea flour were unacceptable, however, mixtures of 75% wheat flour and 25% pigeon pea flour gave cookies of attractive appearance and good taste. The study showed the possibility of preparing and utilizing tropical grain legume flours for food products of relatively high acceptability and nutritive value."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Nutrici\u00f3n de Centro Am\u00e9rica y Panam\u00e1 (INCAP), Guatemala, Guatemala."}], "LastName": "Mueses", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Le\u00f3n", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Estudios sobre la posibilidad de aplicaci\u00f3n de la harina de gandul en productos elaborados a base de arroz o harina de trigo."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8002701"]}}]}
