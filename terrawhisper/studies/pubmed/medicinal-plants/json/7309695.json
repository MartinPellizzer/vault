Two of them, designated as adzuki proteinase inhibitors (API) I-A and I-A', were analyzed for their amino acid sequences by conventional methods. Inhibitors I-A and I-A' exhibited strong homology with other Bowman-Birk type proteinase inhibitors from leguminous seeds in spite of belonging to different genera. Inhibitors I-A and I-A' consisted of 78 and 72 amino acid residues and their molecular weights were 9,100 and 8,300, respectively. Inhibitor I-A' lacked the six amino acid residues of the amino terminus of inhibitor I-A and had an asparagine residue in place of the aspartic acid residue at position 40 of inhibitor I-A. The results showed the occurrence of some genetic variants of proteinase inhibitors in adzuki bean seeds. Inhibitor I-A was a double-headed one, and the reactive sites for trypsin were Lys-Ser and Arg-Ser bonds. Therefore, inhibitor I-A' was also assumed to be a double-headed one having Lys-Ser and Arg-Ser bonds as the reactive sites for the enzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yokota", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Masaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsui", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwasaki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37228-81-2", "NameOfSubstance": "proteinase inhibitor I (plants)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7309695", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a133526"]}}]}
