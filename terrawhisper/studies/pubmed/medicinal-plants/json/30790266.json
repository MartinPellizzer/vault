This study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying the involvement of HOTAIR in neonatal bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). A total of 105 newborns were recruited in this study to collect their peripheral blood mononuclear cell and serum samples, which were then divided into different genotype groups based on the genotypes of rs4759314, rs874945, and rs7958904. The real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, computational analyses, and luciferase assays were performed to establish the regulatory relationships between the HOTAIR, microRNA-126 (miR-126), and interleukin-13 (IL-13). The level of HOTAIR, miR-126, and IL-13 among rs4759314 AA, AG, and GG groups, as well as among rs874945 GG, AG, and AA groups was similar. However, the level of HOTAIR was increased in the rs7958904 GG group, accompanied by a decreased level of miR-126 and IL-13. In addition, the level of airway responsiveness was comparable among rs4759314 AA, AG, and GG groups, as well as among rs874945 GG, AG, and AA groups. However, the airway responsiveness in the groups rs7958904 CG and CC was much stronger than that of the GG group. We also demonstrated that, by directly binding to miR-126, HOTAIR reduced the expression of miR-126, which in turn decreased the expression of IL-13. In summary, we demonstrated the role of HOTAIR-induced downregulation of miR-126 and IL-13 in the development of BHR in neonates."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."},
