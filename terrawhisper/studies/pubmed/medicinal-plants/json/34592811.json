In this work, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-tolerant blue fluorescence N-CDs were added to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated yellow fluorescence quenching of CdTe QDs to construct a dual-color ratiometric fluorescent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probe. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced passivated group detachment and action on deep nanocrystals promoted CdTe QD fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the addition of the blue fluorescent background of N-CDs sharply reflected the color change in CdTe QDs. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the platform was effectively applied to the detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by the enzymatic reaction of glucose, showing high sensitivity (limit of detection 7.86 \u03bcM) and wide linear range (26-900 \u03bcM) for glucose detection. The pH-sensing behavior of CdTe QDs and N-CDs was attributed to the displacement of a weak acid (3-mercaptopropionic acid) by a strong acid (HCl) and the acid titration process of two coexisting bases (N-CDs and NH<sub>3</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O), respectively. The loss of passivation and doping effects led to a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of CdTe QDs and N-CDs. Moreover, utilizing the ability of bimaterial system fluorescence to pH sensing, a semiquantitative pH detection based on the linear response was developed. The pH range was analyzed by three kinds of N-CD (<i>F</i><sub>ex</sub> = 440 nm) and CdTe QD (<i>F</i><sub>ex</sub> = 548 nm) typical emission spectral shapes. In addition, the recovery results showed that the bimaterial system was proved to be appropriate for the assay of glucose in spiked serum samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hanqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xucan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Vocational University of Science and Technology, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiuying", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Fujuan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Chunling", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5330-0689"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Longshan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NQA0O090ZJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Tellurium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "STG188WO13", "NameOfSubstance": "cadmium telluride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Dots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tellurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34592811", "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c02109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
