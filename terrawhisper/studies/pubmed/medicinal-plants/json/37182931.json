In the past, the acetylation modification of wall polysaccharides has been a hot research topic for scientists. However, in recent years, many studies have reported that acetylation-modified plant, animal, and microbial polysaccharide show great potential in delivery systems. From the latest perspective, this review systematically presents the different sources of naturally acetylated polysaccharides, the regularity of their modification, the chemical preparation of acetylation modifications, the biological activities and functions of acetylated polysaccharides, and the application in the delivery system. In nature, acetylated polysaccharides are extensively distributed in plants, microorganism, and animals. The level of acetylation modification, the distribution of chains, and the locations of acetylation modification sites differ between species. An increasing number of acetylated polysaccharides were prepared in the aqueous medium, which is safe, environment friendly, and low-cost. In addition to being necessary for plant growth and development, acetylated polysaccharides have immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. The above-mentioned multiple sources, multifunctional and multi-active acetylated polysaccharides, make them an increasingly important part of delivery systems. We conclude by discussing the future directions for research and development and the potential uses for acetylated polysaccharides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
