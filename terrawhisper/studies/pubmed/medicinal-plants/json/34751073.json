Besides its taste and physiological effects, it exhibits good antioxidant activity in food matrix and antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens and viruses. Considering its low stability and bioaccessibility, and also regarding its irritation, the entrapment methods of capsaicin are fully developed. To compensate the limitations of capsaicin, various encapsulation methods have been used so far, including coacervation, emulsion, spray chilling, and liposomal delivery. Capsaicin has been widely used as a flavoring and preservative agent in food formulations and even as an active compound in packaging film and functional foods. This review provides an overview of the techno-functional properties, stabilization procedures, and burgeoning usages of capsaicin in the latest studies of the food sector. So, it may introduce new windows for the application of this compound."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Nutrition & Food Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezazadeh", "ForeName": "Aida", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamishehkar", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Nutrition & Food Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ehsani", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9928-6808"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Nutrition & Food Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasempour", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghaddas Kia", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34751073", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1997904"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
