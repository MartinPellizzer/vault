The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ti-MOF-NCs were characterized by various techniques, including FESEM, EDX, FTIR, BET, XRD and VSM. Following the extraction process, HPLC was employed to quantify CA. The effects of different parameters on the MD-\u03bc-SPE method were fully investigated by the Plackett-Burman (PBD) and central composite design (CCD). The highest extraction percentage (99.76%) was obtained under different conditions: pH 4.8, 9 mg of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ti-MOF-NCs, sonication for 5 min, and an eluent solvent of 240 \u03bcL. Under optimum conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) were obtained in the range of 0.016-0.021 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.052-0.068 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability (RSDs, n = 5) were in the range of 3.65-8.66% and 1.84-5.54%, respectively. Overall, the proposed method was successfully used to determine CA in the medical extracts of plants and water samples with favorable recoveries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1041-6101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasouj 75918-74831, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradi", "ForeName": "Zohreh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5179-9455"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasouj 75918-74831, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alipanahpour Dil", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3759-8192"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. arash.asfaram@yums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Asfaram", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31194193", "10.1039/c9an00120d"]}}]}
