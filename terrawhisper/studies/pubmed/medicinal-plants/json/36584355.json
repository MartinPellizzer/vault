They possess a double bond in the side chain with different configurations. Double bonds are a class of alert chemical group, due to their metabolic epoxidation to the corresponding epoxides eliciting liver injury. Little is known about changes of configuration on metabolic activation and related toxicity. Here, we report the insight into the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity of asarone with different configurations. In vitro and in vivo comparative studies demonstrated \u03b2A displayed higher metabolic activation effectiveness. Apparently, the major metabolic pathway of \u03b2A underwent epoxidation at C-1' and C-2', while \u03b1A was mainly metabolized to the corresponding alcohol resulting from the hydroxylation of C-3'. CYP1A2 dominated the metabolism of \u03b1A and \u03b2A. The molecular simulation studies showed that the orientation of \u03b2A at the active site of CYP1A2 favored the epoxidation of \u03b2A over that of \u03b1A. These findings not only remind us that configuration is another important factor for toxicities but also facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of toxic action of asarone. Additionally, these findings would benefit the risk assessment of \u03b1A and \u03b2A exposure from foods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, P.
