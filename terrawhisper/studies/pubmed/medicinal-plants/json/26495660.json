After the spleen-qi deficient models were built by comprehensive application of rhubarb, exhaustive and hungry methods, and treatment groups were treated with extract from Hedysarum polybotrys at 6 g/(kg . d) or Sijunzi decoction at 20 g/(kg . d) for 21 d. Then, general existence,gastrointestinal hormones GAS and MOT levels, and activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle were evaluated. Also, confocal laser technology was used to test cellular[Ca2+]i concentrations in skeletal muscle and Western blotting technique was used to test CaM, CaMK II and p-CaMK 11 expression in intestinal tissue of spleen-qi deficient model rats.", "Compared with normal group, general condition was poor, levels of GAS and MOT decreased (P <0. 01), activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase, [Ca2+]i concentration as well as expression of CaM, CaMK II and p-CaMK II in skeletal muscle decreased significantly (P < 0. 01) in spleen-qi deficienct model rats. Compared with model group, general condition improved significantly, as well as level of MOT in intestinal increased (P <0. 05) in the rats of extract from Hedysarum polybotrys group and Sijunzi decoction group,while level of GAS increased in intestinal(P <0. 05) in the rats of Sijunzi decoction group; Moreover, activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase as well as [Ca2+]i concentration and expression of CaM and CaMK II in skeletal muscle tissue increased (P < 0. 05) in the rats of extract from Hedysarum polybotrys group and Sijunzi decoction group, while p-CaMK II in skeletal muscle tissue increased in the rats of Sijunzi decoction group (P < 0. 05).", "Sijunzi decoction and extract of Hedysarum polybotrys can be applied to treat spleen-qi deficiency syndrome through the mechanism of regulating GAS and MOT secretion and raising expression of Ca2+ /CaM signaling pathways key factors in skeletal muscle tissue.
