Its inflorescence is an umbellate cyme, each carrying nearly a thousand flowers; however, its fruiting rate remains remarkably low. The normal development of the anther is a necessary prerequisite for plants to produce seeds. However, our understanding of the anther development process in Cynanchum thesioides remains limited. To better understand the pollen development process in Cynanchum thesioides, the stages of pollen development were determined through paraffin sectioning, and observations were made on the distribution characteristics of polysaccharides and lipid droplets in the pollen development of Cynanchum thesioides using Periodic Acid-Schiff stain (PAS) and 0.5% Sudan Black B tissue staining. Concurrently, the gene expression patterns and metabolite profiles were delineated across various developmental stages of Cynanchum thesioides anthers (T1: microspore stage, T2: tetrad stage, T3: mononuclear stage, and T4: maturation stage). The findings revealed that Cynanchum thesioides pollen is in an aggregate form. Polysaccharides gradually accumulate during maturation and lipid droplets form a surrounding membrane, thereby preventing pollen dispersion. Furthermore, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses across distinct developmental phases uncovered a plethora of differentially expressed genes and metabolites associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Flavonoid levels exhibited dynamic changes concurrent with anther development, aligning with the gene regulatory patterns of the corresponding biosynthetic pathways. The study identified 63 differentially accumulated flavonoid compounds and 21 differentially expressed genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed six MYB and ten bHLH transcription factors as key candidates involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, with CtbHLH (Cluster-6587.1050) and CtMYB (Cluster-6587.31743) specifically regulating structural genes within the pathway. These findings underscore the pivotal role of flavonoid biosynthesis in anther development of Cynanchum thesioides. In conclusion, this research offers a comprehensive insight into the anther development process in Cynanchum thesioides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
