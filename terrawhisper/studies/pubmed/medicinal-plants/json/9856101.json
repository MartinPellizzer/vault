Sequence analysis of the 4136 nucleotide genomes of SBMV-BARK and SBMV-S revealed seven nucleotide differences, but only four deduced amino acid changes. A single amino acid change occurred in the C-terminal region of the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and three differences were identified in the N-terminal portion of the virus coat protein. SBMV-BARK and SBMV-S were compared with other sobemoviruses and were found to contain a high level of nucleotide sequence identity (91.3%) to SBMV-B. Unlike SBMV-B however, SBMV-BARK and SBMV-S contained four putative overlapping open reading frames, making them more similar in genome organization to the cowpea strain, SBMV-C. The possibility exists that mutations or even errors, that resulted in mis-identification of open reading frames, occurred in previously published information on nucleotide sequence and genomic organization for SBMV-B."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF055887", "AF055888"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.48", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9856101", "10.1007/s007050050451"]}}]}
