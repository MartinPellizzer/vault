The counts showed that in some cases there was no influence on the micro-organisms compared with the control, in some cases their numbers increased. On the other hand, depressive effects were recorded for varying periods. This supports the evidence that the pesticides are attacked by several types and groups of rhizospheric microflora; in some cases the by-products may be more toxic than the original toxicants. Generally, however, the recorded effects differed according to the chemical composition of the pesticides, the type and growth phase of each individual plant, and the micro-organisms concerned."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Nasser", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Makawi", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Moneim", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Beitr Trop Landwirtsch Veterinarmed", "NlmUniqueID": "0410253", "ISSNLinking": "0301-567X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depression, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["539994"]}}]}
