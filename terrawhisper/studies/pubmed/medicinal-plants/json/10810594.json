Juss) (NCL-11) was studied regarding its activity and possible mechanism of action against Coxsackie B group of viruses. NCL-11 inhibited plaque formation in 6 antigenic types of Coxsackie virus B at a concentration of 1000 micrograms/ml at 96 hrs. 'in vitro'. Additionally virus inactivation, yield reduction and effect of time of addition assays suggested that NCL-11 was most effective against coxsackie virus B-4 as a virucidal agent besides interfering at an early event of its replicative cycle. The evidence suggested that presence of a battery of compounds besides flavonoids, triterpenoids and their glycosides in NCL-11 have antiviral action for coxsackie B group of viruses 'in vitro.' The minimal inhibitory concentrations were not toxic to Vero (African green monkey kidney), cells; subtoxic concentration was 8,000 micrograms/ml and cytotoxic concentration 10,000 micrograms/ml, which was confirmed by trypan blue dye exclusion test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Virology, Pune, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badam", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedekar", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Commun Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0261652", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5138"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus B, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10810594"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
