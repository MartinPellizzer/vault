It is estimated that about 18 million people have a high death ratio due to the incidence of CVDs such as (stroke, coronary heart disease, and non-ischemic heart failure). Bioactive compounds (BACs) are healthy nutritional ingredients providing beneficial effects and nutritional value to the human body. Epidemiological studies strongly shed light on several bioactive compounds that are favorable candidates for CVDs treatment. Globally, the high risk of CVDs and related results on human body parts made them a serious scenario in all communities. In this present review, we intend to collect previously published data concerned over the years concerning green-colored foods and their BACs that aim to work in the prevention, diagnosis, and/or systematic treating CVDs. We also comprehensively discussed the oral delivery of several bioactive compounds derived from fruits and vegetables and their bioavailability and physiological effects on human health. Moreover, their important characteristics, such as anti-inflammatory, lowering blood pressure, anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-diabetics, lipid-lowering responses, improving atherosclerosis, and cardio protective properties, will be elaborated further. More precisely, medicinal plants' advantages and multifaceted applications have been reported in this literature to treat CVDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is our first attempt that will open a new window in the area of CVDs with the opportunity to achieve a better prognosis and effective treatment for CVDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
