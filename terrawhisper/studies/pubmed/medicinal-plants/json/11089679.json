Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of at least five ACS genes in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) genome. Four complete and one partial sequences representing different ACS genes were cloned from the lupin genomic library. The levels of expression of two of the genes, LA-ACS1 and LA-ACS3, were found to increase after hypocotyl wounding. Apparently, these two genes were up-regulated by exogenous IAA treatment of seedlings. The LA-ACS3 mRNA levels were also elevated in the apical part of hypocotyl, which is reported to contain a high endogenous auxin concentration. This gene may be involved in the auxin- and ethylene-controlled apical hook formation. The expression of the LA-ACS4 gene was found to be almost undetectable. This gene may represent a \"silent\" twin of LA-ACS5 as these two genes share a considerable level of homology in coding and non-coding regions. The LA-ACS5 mRNA is strongly up-regulated in the embryonic axis of germinating seeds at the time of radicle emergence, and was also found in roots and hypocotyls of lupin seedlings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia, Oeiras, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bekman", "ForeName": "E P", "Initials": "EP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saibo", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Cataldo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Regalado", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ricardo", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodrigues-Pousada", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF119410", "AF119411", "AF119412", "AF119413", "AF119414"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.14", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylate synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cotyledon"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomic Library"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypocotyl"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multigene Family"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11089679", "10.1007/s004250000328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
