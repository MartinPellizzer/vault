Acute nociceptive stimuli (pinch, press, heat) applied to the hind paw induced a transient increase in [K+]e of about 0.1-0.5 mM which persisted for 5-30 s. Regional variations in [K+]e were found in unstimulated rat spinal cords. The K+ level in the lower dorsal horn (laminae III-V) was by about 0.4 +/- 0.06 mM higher than that in more superficial laminae and in the ventral horn. Chemical or thermal injury was evoked by: s.c. injection of 0.1-0.5 ml formalin or turpentine into the hind paw, by application of mustard oil onto the skin, or by thermal injury of the hind paw. These produced a long-term increase in [K+]e in the lower dorsal horn by 0.3-3.0 mM in 75% of animals (n = 27). The increase in [K+]e began 5-15 min after injury and persisted for more than 2 h. In the rest of the animals, occasional elevation in [K+]e of 0.1-0.3 mM were observed. The K+ increases evoked by acute nociceptive stimuli as well as by injury were blocked by preinjecting the hind paw with 1% procaine. However, when procaine was applied 20 min or later after injury, the evoked long-term rise in [K+]e was not affected. This shows that the long-term K+ accumulation results from self-sustained abnormal neuronal firing induced in the dorsal horn by injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiological Regulation, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Prague."}], "LastName": "Svoboda", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Motin", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "H\u00e1jek", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sykov\u00e1", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Brain Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0045503", "ISSNLinking": "0006-8993"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TYY1MA9BSY", "NameOfSubstance": "mustard oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XJ6RUH0O4G", "NameOfSubstance": "Turpentine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evoked Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spinal Cord"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turpentine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3208102", "10.1016/0006-8993(88)90500-8", "0006-8993(88)90500-8"]}}]}
