Although several ALK inhibitors have been advanced to clinical trials, the emergence of drug resistance has limited the clinical application of them. To overcome the drug resistance, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) could be an alternative strategy. In this study, a series of ALK degraders were designed and synthesized. The degraders were developed through the conjugation of LDK378 and CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Among all the molecules, compound B3 showed potent selective inhibitory activity to ALK and can decrease the cellular levels of ALK fusion proteins in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in H3122\u00a0cell line. Meanwhile, B3 showed improved anticancer activity in\u00a0vitro comparing with LDK378 and the antiproliferative activity to xenograft tumor model was acceptable. All the results demonstrated that ALK degrader B3 with in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo anti-cancer activities was valuable for further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
