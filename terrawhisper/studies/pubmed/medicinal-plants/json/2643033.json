The plant enzymes increased the mutagenic response of these mixtures above that obtained in the absence of S9. The optimum S9 protein concentration for the activation of the nitrated pyrene mixture at 0.1 microgram was 3.9 mg/plate whereas that for the ozonized pyrene mixture at 33.3 micrograms was 3.2 mg protein/plate. BSA could not replace S9, and NADPH was a required co-factor in the activation of both mixtures by pea S9. Although the nitrated pyrene mixture was determined to consist of approximately 90% 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenic response due to this compound ranged from 30 to 50% of that of the mixture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Studies, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge 70803."}], "LastName": "Shane", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Looney", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2643033", "10.1016/0165-1218(89)90030-x", "0165-1218(89)90030-X"]}}]}
