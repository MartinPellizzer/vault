This systematic review aims to provide the current literature to validate the traditional use of medicinal herbs in the management of gingival and periodontal diseases.", "An online literature search was conducted to identify research papers published from 2010 to 2022 in three major scientific databases, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, in June 2022. Original research studies, case reports, and systematic reviews on medicinal plants' application in oral health care were selected to be included in this systematic review. Only high-quality articles identified in the quality assessment were included for evidence synthesis.", "Initial keyword research yielded 726 free-text articles published between 2010 and 2022. Of these, 14 articles (8 research papers and 6 reviews) were included for evidence synthesis. The review's findings indicate that the antibacterial property of medicinal plants is due to their alkaline nature and prevents plaque and calculus formation by maintaining acid-alkali balance in saliva. Various parts of medicinal plants help maintain periodontal health. <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i>, <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, and <i>Plantago major</i> effectively inhibit primary plaque colonizers and periodontal pathogens. <i>Medicago sativa</i>, <i>Aloe barbadensis</i> Miller, and <i>Trifolium pratense</i> have excellent applications in treating periodontal diseases. <i>Mangifera indica</i>, <i>Pongamia pinnata</i>, the husk of <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, the root of <i>G. glabra</i> and <i>Curcuma longa</i>, leaves of <i>Psidium guajava</i> and <i>Azadirachta indica</i>, fruits of <i>Citrus medica</i> and <i>Punica granatum</i>, Ocimum <i>Moringa oleifera</i> extract, and pomegranate peel extract can serve as a promising alternative in managing chronic gingivitis.", "The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and astringent action of extracts obtained from various parts of medicinal plants make them effective in reducing gingival and periodontal diseases.
