(Malvaceae) and Punica granatum Linn. (Punicaceae) are important medicinal plants in Iranian traditional medicine (Unani) whose have been used as remedy against edema, bum, wound and for their carminative, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. The diethyl ether extract of M. sylvestris and P. granatum flowers were used to evaluate the wound healing activity at 200 mg/kg/day dose in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Wounds were induced in Wister rats divided into six groups as following; Group I, normal rats were treated with simple ointment base. Group II, diabetic rats were treated with simple ointment base (control). Groups III and IV, diabetic rats were treated with simple ointment base containing of extracts (diabetic animals), Groups V, diabetic rats were treated with simple ointment base containing of mixed extracts (1:1), Group VI, diabetic rats received the standard drug (nitrofurazone). The efficacy of treatment was evaluated based on wound area relative and histopathological characteristics. The extract-treated diabetic animals showed significant reduction in the wound area when compared with control. Also, histological studies of the tissue obtained on days 9th and 18th from the extract-treated by extract of M. sylvestris showed increased well organized bands of collagen, more fibroblasts and few inflammatory cells. These findings demonstrate that extract of M. sylvestis effectively stimulates wound contraction as compared to control group and other groups. M. sylvestris accelerated wound healing in rats and thus supports its traditional use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Researches Centre of Medicinal Plants & Ethno-veterinary, Islamic Azad University, Shahrekord Branch, Shahrekord, Iran. ghasemi955@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pirbalouti", "ForeName": "Abdollah Ghasemi", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Shahrzad", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koohpayeh", "ForeName": "Abed", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Behzad", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SW5YHA5NG", "NameOfSubstance": "Alloxan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alloxan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lythraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20873419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
