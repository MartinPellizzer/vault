A literature survey was performed in PubMed, UpToDate, Proquest Central Databases of K\u0131r\u0131kkale University, Google and Google Scholar databases from the internet. Search key words were \"immune\", \"immune system\", \"herbal\", \"Pelargonium Sidoides\", \"Echinacea Purpurea\", \"Sambucus Nigra\", \"Beta Glucan\", \"Vitamin C\", \"Zinc\". The immune system is a natural self-defense mechanism made up of cells that assist the body in distinguishing between self and non-self-molecules. All immune system components must be regularly modified in order to keep the body defenses up against the ever-evolving microbes that are constantly looking for new ways to attack the host. A Chinese herbal formulation is a combination of several herbs. The practitioner begins with one or two major substances that are intended to treat the ailment. The reproducibility of the efficacy of herbal medicines is dependent on the consistency of the quality of each unique raw herb. Pelargonium Sidoides, Echinacea Purpurea, Sambucus Nigra, Beta Glucan, Vitamin C, and Zinc are some herbal treatments utilized for their benefits on human immunity. Herbal remedies are undoubtedly valuable in boosting impaired immune function, particularly where damage has occurred due to malnutrition, chronic disease or previous infections. At present, however, an invincible immune system remains firmly in the realm of fantasy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey. nbayarmuluk@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Cingi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bayar Muluk", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tezol", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u00c7ukurova", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pelargonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sambucus nigra"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37350689", "10.26355/eurrev_202306_32743", "32743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
