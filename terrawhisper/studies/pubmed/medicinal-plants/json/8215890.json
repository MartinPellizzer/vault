In Experiment 1 (5 x 5 Latin square), five Holstein steers (198 kg) had ad libitum access to alfalfa cubes (17% CP) without supplementation or with corn at 0.25 or 0.75% body weight (BW) alone (LC or HC) or with 0.06% BW of zeolite (chabazite; LC-Z and HC-Z). Total daily organic water (OM) intake was not affected by treatment (6.08, 6.14, 6.11, 6.19 and 6.09 kg for control, LC, LC-Z, HC and HC-Z, respectively; SE 0.25). In Experiment 2, Simmental crossbred beef calves grazed fescue-clover paddocks in the spring (clipped forage: 21 to 27% CP) for 84 days and were supplemented with 0.25 or 0.75% BW corn alone or with added zeolite (0.06% BW) or lasalocid (0.5 mg/kg BW). Daily gain did not differ among treatments (1.24 to 1.31 kg/day). In Experiment 3 (6 x 6 Latin square), six Holstein steer calves (168 kg) had ad libitum access to medium-quality, orchardgrass-clover hay (15% CP). Steers received one of the following six treatments: no supplement (Control), 0.35% BW ground corn (C), corn plus 0.049% BW urea (C-U), 0.35% BW soybean meal (S), 0.205% BW feather meal (F) or 0.103% BW feather meal, 0.052% BW blood meal and 0.067% BW corn gluten meal (F-BG). Total daily OM intake was 5.00, 5.14, 5.00, 5.11, 4.84 and 4.70 kg for control, C, C-U, S, F and F-BG, respectively (SE 0.13). In Experiment 4 (6 x 6 Latin square), six Holstein steer calves (226 kg) were fed 0.75% BW of alfalfa cubes (19% CP) plus ad libitum access to medium- to high-quality orchardgrass hay (16% CP). Steers received one of the following six treatments: no supplement (Control), corn at 0.25% BW alone (c) or mixed with 0.12% BW peanut skins (C-PSK), a mix of high-CP feedstuffs high in ruminal escape protein (0.029% BW blood meal, 0.038% BW corn gluten meal and 0.028% BW feather meal; C-REP), 0.139% soybean meal (C-S) or soybean meal plus peanut skins (C-PSK-S). Total daily OM intake was 6.16, 6.25, 6.13, 6.52, 6.50 and 6.60 kg for control, C, C-PSK, C-REP, C-S and C-PSK-S, respectively (SE 0.10).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Animal and Poultry Sciences, University of Arkansas Fayetteville 72701."}], "LastName": "Goetsch", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Galloway", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL", "Suffix": "Sr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forster", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "West", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Tierernahr", "NlmUniqueID": "0217641", "ISSNLinking": "0003-942X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8215890", "10.1080/17450399309386066"]}}]}
