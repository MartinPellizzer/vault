In August 2021, root rot of <i>I. verum</i> was first observed on more than 80% of the plants grown within a 500 hectares area in Wenshan city, Yunnan Province. At the early stage of the disease, the phloem of the root was dark yellow-brown, and the leaves turn yellow. With further disease development, the whole root became black (Fig. 1a, 1b), and the leaves gradually fall off, affecting the growth, yield and eventually caused death of the whole plant. A total of 20 root samples were collected from typical symptomatic plant roots with 20 years old in Wenshan City (23\u00b018'12\u2033N, 103\u00b056'98\u2033E) and were cut into 2 \u00d7 2 mm pieces at the junction of infected and healthy tissue. Each sample was surface-sterilized with 3% NaClO and 75% alcohol for 60 s before rinsing three times with distilled water. The sterile filter paper (5\u00d75 cm) was used to dry the tissue, and samples were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate (50 \u03bcg/ml). Plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark in the incubator. From 9 isolates obtained in culture, 7 exhibited the morphology described by Boerema et al. (Boerema et al. 2004) for <i>Setophoma</i> sp. The hyphae were hyaline and septate (Fig.1c). After 14 days of culture on V8 juice agar, white round colonies are formed, but there is no groove in the middle of the colonies (Fig.1d), and transparent, oval, or cylindrical conidia were produced, 6.0-8.0 x 2.5 to 4.0 um (Fig.1e). DNA was extracted from a representative isolate BJGF-04 for molecular identification using a fungal genomic DNA extraction kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed with primers ITS1/ITS4 for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (White et al. 1990) and primers T1/\u03b2-Sandy-R for the \u03b2-tubulin gene (TUB) region (Yang et al. 2017) and primers NL3/ LR5 for 28S large subunit rDNA (LSU) region (Hu et al. 2021) and NS1/ NS4 for 5.8S large subunit rDNA (SSU) region (Mahesha et al. 2021). Newly generated representative sequences were deposited in GenBank: ITS sequence (ON645256), TUB sequence (ON854484), and LSU sequence (ON644445), SSU sequence (ON644451). were sequenced and blasted, showing 99 to 100% sequence homology with known <i>S. terrestris</i>. Pathogenicity was performed using one-year asymptomatic plants of <i>I. verum</i>. A conidial suspension (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> conidia/ml) collected from V8 juice cultures with 0.05% Tween buffer was poured at a volume of 10 ml/plant. Three individual seedlings were used as replicates for each treatment, and sterile water was used as the negative control. All plants were placed in an artificial climate incubator at 25\u00b0C under 90% relative humidity. After 20 days, all inoculated plants showed symptoms identical to those described above, whereas controls remained healthy. <i>Setophoma terrestris</i> was reisolated from the infected roots, which was confirmed by morphological and molecular identification, which completed Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>S. terrestris</i> as a causal agent of root rot on <i>I. verum</i> in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University College of Forestry, 563013, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; LuofengyingGrace@126.com."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Fengying", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2841148685@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ganzi Institute of Forestry Research, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; Helenliuhan@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, 12529, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Forestry and Grassland Administration Key Laboratory of Forest Resources Conservation and Ecological Safety on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River & Forestry Ecological Engineering in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China; lishuying127@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, No. 211, Huimin Road,, Wenjiang District, Chengdu, China, 611130; zhuth1227@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tianhui", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, College of Forestry, No. 211 Huimin Road, Chengdu, United States, 611130."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No. 211 Huimin RoadChengdu, 611130; hanshan6618@163.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 120470952@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Guoguang Agrochemical Co., Ltd., China, Chengdu, China; 290514100@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Youzhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Forestry and Grassland Administration Key Laboratory of Forest Resources Conservation and Ecological Safety on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River & Forestry Ecological Engineering in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China; 14087@sicau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shujiang", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36995770", "10.1094/PDIS-01-23-0048-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
