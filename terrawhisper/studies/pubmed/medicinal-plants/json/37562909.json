People with HIV are prone to these opportunistic infections like TB due to the immunocompromised condition. In the present study, the nanoparticles and nanoconjugates were screened for effective anti-mycobacterial efficiency against opportunistic infections.", "Incidentally, the nanoparticles were biosynthesized using single plant extract. The biosynthesized nanoparticles were initially screened for effective anti-tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the effective antimicrobial activity, a nanoconjugate was biosynthesized combining three plant extracts for a cumulative activity.", "The biosynthesized gold nanoparticles and nanoconjugates showed MIC demonstrating for 99% inhibition and MIC<sub>99</sub> was found to be 6.42\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Among all the 15 nanoparticles tested, seven NPs showed exceptional anti-TB activities NP1, NP2, NP6, NP7, NP10, NP12 and NP15 and the other nanoparticles exhibited varying degrees of inhibition - anti-TB activities. In the 12 nanoconjugate tested, seven nanoconjugate demonstrated exceptional anti-TB activities such as NCC1, NCC2, NCC5, NCC6, NCV1, NCV6 and NCV4.", "The objective of the study was to identify the nanoparticles and nanoconjugates which demonstrated potential activity against M. tuberculosis so that a single nanoparticle or nanoconjugate can be targeted to treat patients with TB. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the biosynthesized gold nanoparticles and nanoconjugates were determined against M. tuberculosis H37Rv."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Tuberculosis Association of India.
