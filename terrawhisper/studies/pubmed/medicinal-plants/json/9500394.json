Eupolin ointment is a topical agent used in the treatment of soft-tissue wounds and burns in Vietnam and is made from an aqueous extract of the leaves of Chromolaena odorata (formerly Eupatorium odoratum). Clinical studies using this extract have shown antimicrobial and anticoagulation effects as well as the promotion of tissue remodeling in the wound healing process. However, the mechanism by which this agent affects cells involved in the wound healing process is unknown. In our research, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, two cell types that play a crucial role in wound healing, were used to investigate some of the effects of Eupolin extract in vitro. Cell growth was estimated by a colorimetric assay at different time intervals. Enhanced growth of fibroblasts and endothelial cells was found at concentrations of 10 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml of Eupolin extract. This was particularly evident in medium supplemented with only 0.5% fetal calf serum where the cells were quiescent. Toxicity of the extract to fibroblasts was observed at 250 microg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.5% fetal calf serum, but there was no significant damage at this dose to the endothelial cells. The results of the study demonstrated that Eupolin extract increased fibroblast and endothelial cell growth, and this could explain in part the beneficial clinical effects that have been observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wound Healing Institute, Headington, Oxford, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Phan", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cherry", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plast Reconstr Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "1306050", "ISSNLinking": "0032-1052"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticoagulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EUY85H477I", "NameOfSubstance": "thiazolyl blue"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticoagulants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Soft Tissue Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9500394", "10.1097/00006534-199803000-00027"]}}]}
