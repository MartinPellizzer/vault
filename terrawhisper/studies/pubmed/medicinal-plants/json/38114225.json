As a widely used TCM injection, Shuganning Injection, its in vivo processes are not yet fully understood. Determining the plasma protein binding rate is of great significance for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. In this experiment, the equilibrium dialysis method combined with UPLC-MS/MS technology was used to determine the plasma protein binding rates of 10 components, including p-hydroxyacetophenone, caffeic acid, baicalein, oroxylin A, geniposide, baicalin, cynaroside, oroxylin A-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, scutellarin, and hyperoside, in Shuganning Injection in rat and human plasma to provide a theoretical basis for further elucidating the in vivo processes of Shuganning Injection and guiding clinical medication. The results showed that, except for baicalein and geniposide, the plasma protein binding rates of the other eight components were higher in human plasma than in rat plasma, and there were interspecies differences. In human plasma, except for geniposide, caffeic acid, and baicalin, the plasma protein binding rates of the remaining seven components were above 80%, with baicalein and oroxylin A exceeding 90%. All components exhibit a high level of binding to plasma proteins, with the exception of geniposide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jin-Chao", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "145295QLXY", "NameOfSubstance": "geniposide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Renal Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "45"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38114225", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230618.204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
