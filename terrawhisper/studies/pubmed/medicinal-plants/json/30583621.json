P. tunicoides is an endangered species included in the secondary protection list in China Plant Red Data Book as well as the endemic species in Southwest China. Its natural resources could not meet the needs of pharmaceutical production. Construction of core collection of P. tunicoides will lay the foundation for germplasm improvement and molecular breeding. The sequence variation of the key enzymes gene locus (\u03b2-AS) were carried out to survey the population structure and population history of the species. Among the 11 populations across its geographical range, 36 haplotypes were identified. The levels of haplotype diversity (Hd=0.905) were high, while the levels of population differentiation (GST=0.280) were low. Analysisof molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that a significantly greater proportion of total genetic variationpartitioned among populations thanwithin populations (values of 77.43% and 22.57%, respectively). These results in combination with the star-like phylogenetic network analysis indicate that Hap1 as an ancestral haplotypewas shared in four populations, Hap2, Hap4, Hap15 and Hap16 are occurred in two populations, the remains as private haplotype only distributed in single population. The strategy of core collection was constructed in order to maximumpreserve genetic diversity of P. tunicoides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwestern University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong 637000, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Li-Ling", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ya-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Zi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory of Dai and Yi Medicines, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guo-Dong", "Initials": "GD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetics, Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haplotypes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30583621", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2018.0111"]}}]}
