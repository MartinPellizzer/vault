S. sieboldii) is a widely cultivated crop, and its rhizome is used as a medicinal vegetable. To investigate the causes of viral diseases in Chinese artichokes, the infection rates of four virus species infecting Chinese artichoke were investigated. Since the Chinese artichoke propagates through its tuber, this study aimed to determine whether viral transmission to the progeny is possible through the tuber, by identifying the virus present in the tuber and investigating its accumulation. First, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to detect viruses using total RNA extracted from the flowers, leaves, and tubers of Chinese artichoke plants. Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and Chinese artichoke mosaic virus (ChAMV) had high infectivity in Chinese artichoke and most plants were simultaneously infected with AMV and ChAMV. These viruses were present in all tissues, but their detection frequency and accumulation rates varied across different tissues of the Chinese artichoke. Also, we sequenced the coat protein (CP) genes of AMV and ChAMV to investigate genetic variations of virus between the leaf and tuber. It provides information on CP gene sequences and genetic diversity of isolates identified from new hosts of AMV and ChAMV. This study offers valuable insights into the distribution and spread of the ChAMV and AMV within Chinese artichoke plants, which have implications for the management and control of viral infections in crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Medicine, Division of Bio-Resource Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Ji-Soo", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Medicine, Division of Bio-Resource Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Min", "ForeName": "Dong-Joo", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Medicine, Division of Bio-Resource Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Tae-Seon", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Medicine, Division of Bio-Resource Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "You-Seop", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Medicine, Division of Bio-Resource Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Jin-Sung", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "PJ14983", "Agency": "Rural Development Administration", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Plant Pathol J", "NlmUniqueID": "100966769", "ISSNLinking": "1598-2254"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39117337", "10.5423/PPJ.OA.06.2024.0094", "PPJ.OA.06.2024.0094"]}}]}
